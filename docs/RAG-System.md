# RAG System (Experimental)

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: This is an experimental feature for testing/demo purposes. The system is basic and largely untested.**

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system enhances the AI Game Master with context-aware D&D 5e knowledge. When players take actions, the system automatically retrieves relevant rules, spells, monster information, and lore to provide the AI with accurate context.

## What It Does

The RAG system analyzes player actions and automatically injects relevant D&D 5e information into the AI's context:

- **Smart Query Generation**: Converts player actions into targeted knowledge queries
- **Multi-Source Retrieval**: Searches across rules, spells, monsters, and lore databases
- **Relevance Filtering**: Only includes the most pertinent information to avoid prompt bloat
- **Context Enhancement**: Provides the AI with accurate D&D 5e knowledge for better responses

## Knowledge Bases

The system includes four core knowledge bases located in the `knowledge/` directory:

### üìñ Rules (`rules.json`)
- Attack rolls and damage mechanics
- Spellcasting rules and saving throws
- Combat actions and initiative
- Conditions and status effects
- Resting and recovery rules

### ‚ú® Spells (`spells.json`)
- Spell descriptions and mechanics
- Casting requirements and components
- Spell slot usage and limitations
- School-specific spell effects

### üëπ Monsters (`monsters.json`)
- Creature statistics and abilities
- Combat tactics and behaviors
- Special attacks and defenses
- Challenge ratings and encounter balance

### üåç Lore (`lore.json`)
- World-building and setting information
- NPC backgrounds and motivations
- Location descriptions and history
- Adventure hooks and plot elements

## How It Works

1. **Action Analysis**: When a player submits an action, the RAG query engine analyzes the text
2. **Query Generation**: Creates targeted queries based on detected keywords and context
3. **Knowledge Retrieval**: Searches relevant knowledge bases for matching information
4. **Smart Filtering**: Applies relevance scoring and deduplication to optimize results
5. **Context Injection**: Adds the most relevant knowledge to the AI's prompt

## Example Workflow

```
Player Action: "I cast Fireball at the goblins"
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ RAG Analysis: Detects spell casting + specific spell + combat
‚îú‚îÄ Generated Queries: 
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ "Fireball spell mechanics and damage"
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ "Spellcasting rules and saving throws"
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ "Combat actions and area effects"
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ Knowledge Retrieved:
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Fireball: "3rd-level evocation, 20-foot radius, Dex save..."
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Spell Save DC: "8 + spellcasting modifier + proficiency..."
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Area Effects: "Creatures in area make saving throws..."
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ AI Response: Uses retrieved knowledge for accurate spell resolution
```

## Configuration

The RAG system is automatically enabled and requires no additional configuration. It operates with these default settings:

- **Relevance Threshold**: 2.0 (minimum score for inclusion)
- **Max Results Per Category**: 2 items
- **Max Total Results**: 5 items
- **Similarity Threshold**: 0.7 (for deduplication)

## Current Limitations

Since this is an experimental system for testing purposes:

- **Limited Testing**: The system has not undergone comprehensive testing
- **Basic Implementation**: Uses simple keyword matching rather than advanced semantic search
- **Manual Knowledge Base**: The knowledge bases are manually curated and may be incomplete
- **No Vector Search**: Does not use embeddings or vector similarity search
- **Static Filtering**: Relevance scoring is rule-based rather than learned

## Technical Details

The RAG system consists of several components:

- **`app/core/rag_interfaces.py`**: Core interfaces and data models
- **`app/services/rag/rag_service.py`**: Main RAG service implementation
- **`app/services/rag/query_engine.py`**: Action analysis and query generation
- **`app/services/rag/knowledge_bases.py`**: Knowledge base implementations
- **`app/routes/rag_routes.py`**: API endpoints for RAG operations

## Testing

Basic unit tests are available in `tests/unit/test_rag_system.py`. Integration testing can be performed using `tests/script_test_rag_integration.py`.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the RAG system include:

- Vector embeddings for semantic similarity search
- Machine learning-based relevance scoring
- Expanded knowledge bases with more comprehensive D&D 5e content
- Real-time knowledge base updates
- Performance optimization for larger datasets
- Integration with official D&D 5e APIs
