#### Phase 6.2: Model & Event Improvements (Week 2) - IN PROGRESS

1. **Model Reorganization** ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-17) ✅ **VERIFIED** (2025-06-17)
   - Split large model files into logical sub-packages:
     - **character.py** (372 lines) → `character/` sub-package:
       - `template.py`: CharacterTemplateModel (static data)
       - `instance.py`: CharacterInstanceModel (dynamic state)
       - `combined.py`: CombinedCharacterModel (DTO)
       - `utils.py`: CharacterModifierDataModel, CharacterData
     - **events.py** (306 lines) → `events/` sub-package:
       - `base.py`: BaseGameEvent

   - Type checking passes (mypy --strict: 0 errors)
   - All tests passing (882 passed, 1 skipped)
   - Verified 2025-06-17: All changes working correctly, original files reduced from ~300-370 lines to ~25-28 lines (deprecation warnings only)

2. **Event System Refactoring** ❌ **ABANDONED** (2025-06-17)
    - Started implementing EventBus pattern but determined it added complexity without value
    - Current event system works adequately for the application's needs
    - Better to focus on actual business logic improvements

3. **Additional Factories** ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-17) ✅ **VERIFIED WITH INTEGRATION** (2025-06-17)
   - `CombatFactory` - Creates combat states and combatants
   - `QuestFactory` - Creates quests and objectives  
   - `NPCFactory` - Creates NPCs with consistent structure
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for all factories
   - Type-safe implementation with mypy --strict compliance
   - Integrated into ServiceContainer
   - **Integration Status**:
     - CombatFactory: Successfully integrated into ICombatService
       - Moved all combatant creation logic from ICombatService to factory

       - Factory handles both PC and NPC combatant creation with proper initiative
       - Made factory helper methods private for clean public interface
     - QuestFactory: Created but not integrated (quests managed via AI responses)
     - NPCFactory: Created but not integrated (NPCs managed via AI responses)
   - **Code Quality**: Fixed private method usage based on Gemini review
   - **Note**: AC calculation simplified (10 + DEX modifier) - proper equipment-based calculation would require ContentService integration
   - All tests passing (915 passed, 1 skipped)

#### Phase 6.3: Service & API Cleanup (Week 3) - IN PROGRESS

1. **State Processor Decomposition** ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-17) ✅ **VERIFIED WITH CLEANUP** (2025-06-17)
   - **NOTE**: Processors have been relocated to `app/services/state_updaters/` as part of reorganization
   - Split `app/domain/game_model/state_processors.py` (1093 lines) into focused updaters:
     - `CombatStateUpdater` (269 lines) - Core combat state management (start, end, remove)
     - `CombatHPUpdater` (180 lines) - HP change handling
     - `CombatConditionUpdater` (198 lines) - Condition add/remove handling
     - `CombatHelpers` (176 lines) - Combat setup helper functions
     - `InventoryUpdater` (243 lines) - Inventory and gold management

   - **Backward Compatibility Cleanup** (2025-06-17):
     - Removed backward compatibility wrapper (`state_processors.py`)
     - Updated `ai_response_processor.py` to import directly from updaters
     - Fixed test imports in `test_state_processors_combat_end.py`
   - **Architecture Benefits**:
     - All files under 300 lines as required
     - Clear separation of concerns
     - No backward compatibility debt
     - All 915 tests passing
     - Type safety maintained (mypy --strict: 0 errors)
   - **Gemini Review (2025-06-17)**:
     - "This is a model refactoring. Well done."
     - Excellent adherence to KISS, YAGNI, DRY, and SOLID principles
     - Massive improvement in Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
     - Future consideration: Move from static methods to dependency injection

### Service Layer Simplification (Phase 3) ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-18)

#### Task 3.1: Remove Orchestration Sub-package ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-18)

Successfully simplified the service layer by removing the orchestration sub-package:

1. **Removed Orchestration Layer**: 
   - Deleted `app/services/orchestration/` directory containing:
     - `CombatOrchestrationService` - Was just a wrapper around DiceSubmissionHandler
     - `NarrativeOrchestrationService` - Was just a wrapper around PlayerActionHandler
     - `EventRoutingService` - Logic integrated directly into GameOrchestrator
   
2. **GameOrchestrator Refactoring**:
   - Now directly instantiates and manages action handlers
   - Integrated event routing logic from EventRoutingService
   - Manages shared context and retry functionality directly
   - Cleaner, flatter architecture that's easier to trace
   
3. **Test Updates**:
   - Fixed `test_game_orchestrator.py` to use direct handler references
   - All 737 unit tests passing
   - No functionality lost during refactoring
   
4. **Architecture Benefits**:
   - Removed unnecessary abstraction layer
   - Reduced indirection and complexity
   - GameOrchestrator is now the single coordinator for all handlers
   - Easier to understand control flow

#### Task 3.2: Extract Shared State Management ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-18)

Successfully implemented thread-safe session state management:

1. **Created SharedStateManager**: 
   - New class in `app/services/shared_state_manager.py`
   - Thread-safe per-session state management
   - Handles AI processing flags, backend triggers, and retry context
   - Session cleanup for expired sessions
   
2. **Updated GameOrchestrator**:
   - Removed shared state instance variables
   - Now uses SharedStateManager for all state management
   - All handler methods updated to accept session_id parameter
   
3. **Updated All Action Handlers**:
   - Added session_id parameter to all handler methods
   - State accessed through SharedStateManager
   - Thread-safe operation for concurrent requests
   
4. **API Routes Updated**:
   - Added session ID generation in `game_routes.py`
   - All endpoints now pass session_id to handlers
   - Uses Flask sessions for consistent session management
   
5. **Test Updates**:
   - All tests updated to use SharedStateManager
   - Fixed test setup to provide session IDs
   - All 901 tests passing (5 skipped)
   
**Architecture Benefits**:
- Thread-safe concurrent request handling
- Proper session isolation
- Clear state management boundaries
- No more shared mutable state on singletons

#### Task 3.4: Standardize Event Types with Enums ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-18)

Successfully replaced magic strings for event types with a type-safe Enum:

1. **Created GameEventType Enum**: 
   - New enum in `app/models/events/event_types.py`
   - Includes all event types: PLAYER_ACTION, DICE_SUBMISSION, NEXT_STEP, RETRY, etc.
   - Inherits from `str` for JSON serialization compatibility
   
2. **Updated GameEventModel**:
   - Changed `type` field from `Literal` to `GameEventType` enum
   - Ensures type safety and autocomplete for event types
   
3. **Updated GameOrchestrator**:
   - All event type comparisons use enum values
   - Better error handling for unknown event types
   
4. **Fixed Circular Imports**:
   - Used `TYPE_CHECKING` imports in event_utils.py and system.py
   - Resolved import cycles between game_state.py and events modules
   
5. **Test Updates**:
   - Updated all test files to use GameEventType enum
   - All 726 unit tests passing
   
**Architecture Benefits**:
- Type safety for event types (no more typos)
- IDE autocomplete for available event types
- Single source of truth for all event types
- JSON serialization works correctly (enum serializes to string value)

#### Task 3.5: Simplify Public API to Single Entry Point ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-18)

Successfully simplified GameOrchestrator to have a single public method for event processing:

1. **Made Handler Methods Private**: 
   - Renamed all public handler methods to private (prefix with _)
   - `handle_player_action` → `_handle_player_action`
   - `handle_dice_submission` → `_handle_dice_submission`
   - `handle_completed_roll_submission` → `_handle_completed_roll_submission`
   - `handle_next_step_trigger` → `_handle_next_step_trigger`
   - `handle_retry` → `_handle_retry`
   
2. **Updated handle_event Method**:
   - Now calls private methods internally
   - Added support for COMPLETED_ROLL_SUBMISSION event type
   - Enhanced documentation to clarify it's the only public entry point
   - Fixed data handling for events without data (use empty dict {} instead of None)
   
3. **Added Backward Compatibility**:
   - Created deprecated wrapper methods for smooth transition
   - Each wrapper shows clear deprecation warning with migration path
   - All wrappers create GameEventModel and call handle_event
   
4. **Test Results**:
   - All 13 unit tests passing
   - Deprecation warnings shown as expected
   - No functionality lost during refactoring
   
**Architecture Benefits**:
- Single, clear entry point for all game events
- Cleaner facade pattern implementation
- Easier to understand and maintain
- Backward compatible for gradual migration

## Phase 6.3 Remaining Tasks (Service & API Cleanup)

### Task 6.3.2: API Route Consolidation (YAGNI) 🔜 **PENDING**
   - Consolidate `d5e_routes.py` (749 lines, 41 endpoints) into logical groups:
     - Use query parameters instead of separate endpoints (e.g., `/api/d5e/content?type=spells&school=evocation`)
     - Reduce to ~10 flexible endpoints total
     - Move complex filtering logic to the service layer
   - Split remaining routes into focused blueprints:
     - `combat_routes.py` - Combat-specific endpoints
     - `reference_routes.py` - D&D reference data
     - `content_management_routes.py` - Content pack management
   
   **Analysis (2025-06-18):**
   - Current structure has clear YAGNI violations:
     - 41 separate endpoints for what are essentially CRUD operations on content types
     - Most endpoints follow pattern: GET /type (list all) and GET /type/{id} (get one)
     - Filtering is done via query params but each type has its own endpoint
   - Proposed consolidated structure:
     - `GET /api/d5e/content?type={type}&{filters}` - Generic list with filtering
     - `GET /api/d5e/content/{type}/{id}` - Generic get by ID
     - Keep specialized endpoints only where needed (search, calculations, composite data)
   - Benefits: Reduce code from 749 to ~200 lines, easier to maintain

### Task 6.3.3: DRY Service Getters 🔜 **PENDING**
   - Create `app/api/dependencies.py` with dependency injection decorators:
     ```python
     @inject_service(ContentService)
     def get_spells(service: ContentService):
         # service is automatically injected
     ```
   - Remove all duplicate `get_*_service()` functions from route files
   - Create shared error handler utility in `app/api/error_handlers.py`
   
   **Analysis (2025-06-18):**
   - Current DRY violations found:
     - Only `d5e_routes.py` has `get_d5e_service()` function
     - `content_routes.py` has `_get_content_pack_service()` and `_get_indexing_service()`
     - Other route files directly call `get_container()` inline (no helper functions)
     - Error handling is duplicated - each route file has its own try/except patterns
     - Only `d5e_routes.py` has `_handle_service_error()` - others duplicate this logic
   - Proposed solution:
     - Create centralized `app/api/dependencies.py` for all service getters
     - Create `app/api/error_handlers.py` with shared error handling
     - Use dependency injection decorators to reduce boilerplate
   - Benefits: Remove ~100 lines of duplicate code across route files

### Task 6.3.4: Response Processor Refactoring 🔜 **PENDING**
    - Split `ai_response_processor.py` (584 lines) by responsibility:
      - Extract handler pattern to separate files
      - Create focused processors: `NarrativeProcessor`, `CombatProcessor`, `StateProcessor`
      - Keep main processor as coordinator only
    
    **Analysis (2025-06-18):**
    - Current violations of Single Responsibility:
      - Main `process_response` method is 113 lines handling multiple concerns
      - Handles: narrative, location, dice requests, turn advancement, RAG updates, state updates
      - Has 14 methods total mixing different responsibilities
      - Already has `DiceRequestHandler` and `TurnAdvancementHandler` as separate classes
    - Proposed refactoring:
      - `NarrativeProcessor`: Handle narrative and location updates (extract methods like `_handle_narrative_and_location`)
      - `StateUpdateProcessor`: Handle all state updates (extract from `_handle_game_state_updates`)
      - `RagProcessor`: Handle RAG event logging (extract from lines 114-183)
      - Keep `AIResponseProcessor` as thin coordinator
    - Benefits: Each processor ~100-150 lines, focused responsibilities, easier testing

## Phase 6.4: Dependency & Architecture Simplification 🔜 **PENDING**

### Task 6.4.1: Event System Simplification (YAGNI)
    - Evaluate which events truly need the full handler pattern
    - Convert simple event handlers to direct method calls where appropriate
    - Remove `SharedHandlerStateModel` if not providing clear value
    - Keep event system only for truly decoupled components
    
    **Analysis (2025-06-18):**
    - Current event system usage:
      - EventQueue used in 12 service files for emitting events
      - Events used primarily for SSE updates to frontend (which makes sense)
      - Some internal events could be direct method calls
    - SharedHandlerStateModel removed in recent refactor - replaced with SharedStateManager
    - Events that should remain:
      - Frontend updates (LocationChangedEvent, CombatStartedEvent, etc.) - needed for SSE
      - Cross-boundary events (errors, system events)
    - Events that could be direct calls:
      - Internal state updates within same service boundary
      - Synchronous operations that don't need decoupling
    - Recommendation: Current event usage is mostly appropriate, minimal changes needed

### Task 6.4.2: Base Handler Decomposition
    - Extract common logic from `base_handler.py` (559 lines) to utilities:
      - `handler_utils.py` - Common validation and error handling
      - `state_utils.py` - State manipulation helpers
      - `event_utils.py` - Event creation and publishing helpers
    - Keep base handler thin (under 100 lines)
    
    **Analysis (2025-06-18):**
    - Current base handler has 14 methods mixing different concerns:
      - AI service interaction (`_call_ai_and_process_step`, `_build_ai_prompt_context`)
      - Frontend formatting (`_format_party_for_frontend`, `_get_state_for_frontend`)
      - Error handling (`_create_error_response`)
      - State management (`_clear_pending_dice_requests`)
    - Proposed extraction:
      - `handler_utils.py`: Error response creation, retry logic
      - `ai_utils.py`: AI prompt building, continuation logic
      - `frontend_utils.py`: All frontend formatting methods
      - `state_query_utils.py`: Methods for querying game state
    - Keep in base: Abstract `handle` method, core initialization
    - Benefits: Each utility module ~100-150 lines, base handler reduced to ~50 lines

## Current Focus: Phase 6.3 - Service & API Cleanup

Completed Phase 3 (Service Layer Simplification) today. Now focusing on remaining Phase 6.3 tasks:
- API Route Consolidation (YAGNI principle)
- DRY Service Getters
- Response Processor Refactoring

### Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Content Service as Single Source of Truth**
   - All D&D 5e data accessed through ContentService
   - No direct JSON file access in the application
   - Content packs control all game content availability

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - `app/content/` - All D&D 5e content management
   - `app/models/` - Runtime game state models only
   - Clear boundary between static content and dynamic state

3. **Type Safety**
   - Use Pydantic models throughout (no TypedDict)
   - Generate TypeScript from Pydantic models
   - Maintain 100% type safety in both backend and frontend

### Phase 6.3 & 6.4 Task Validity Assessment (2025-06-18)

After thorough analysis and discussion, the remaining valid tasks are:

**High Priority (Most Value):**
- Task 6.3.2 (API Consolidation): Would reduce d5e_routes.py from 749 to ~200 lines
- Task 6.3.4 (Response Processor): Would improve testability and maintainability
- Task 6.4.2 (Base Handler): Would reduce base_handler.py from 559 to ~50 lines

**Medium Priority (Good Improvements):**
- Task 6.3.3 (DRY Service Getters): Would eliminate ~100 lines of duplicate code

**Lower Priority (Minimal Changes Needed):**
- Task 6.4.1 (Event System): Current implementation is appropriate for SSE needs

The codebase has already seen significant improvements from earlier phases. The remaining tasks would further polish the architecture following KISS, YAGNI, and DRY principles.
