   - Verified 2025-06-17: All changes working correctly, original files reduced from ~300-370 lines to ~25-28 lines (deprecation warnings only)

2. **Event System Refactoring** ❌ **ABANDONED** (2025-06-17)
    - Started implementing EventBus pattern but determined it added complexity without value
    - Current event system works adequately for the application's needs
    - Better to focus on actual business logic improvements

3. **Additional Factories** ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-17) ✅ **VERIFIED WITH INTEGRATION** (2025-06-17)

     - "This is a model refactoring. Well done."
     - Excellent adherence to KISS, YAGNI, DRY, and SOLID principles
     - Massive improvement in Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
     - Future consideration: Move from static methods to dependency injection

### Service Layer Simplification (Phase 3) 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** (2025-06-18)

#### Task 3.1: Remove Orchestration Sub-package ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-18)

Successfully simplified the service layer by removing the orchestration sub-package:

1. **Removed Orchestration Layer**: 
   - Deleted `app/services/orchestration/` directory containing:
     - `CombatOrchestrationService` - Was just a wrapper around DiceSubmissionHandler
     - `NarrativeOrchestrationService` - Was just a wrapper around PlayerActionHandler
     - `EventRoutingService` - Logic integrated directly into GameOrchestrator
   
2. **GameOrchestrator Refactoring**:
   - Now directly instantiates and manages action handlers
   - Integrated event routing logic from EventRoutingService
   - Manages shared context and retry functionality directly
   - Cleaner, flatter architecture that's easier to trace
   
3. **Test Updates**:
   - Fixed `test_game_orchestrator.py` to use direct handler references
   - All 737 unit tests passing
   - No functionality lost during refactoring
   
4. **Architecture Benefits**:
   - Removed unnecessary abstraction layer
   - Reduced indirection and complexity
   - GameOrchestrator is now the single coordinator for all handlers
   - Easier to understand control flow

#### Task 3.2: Extract Shared State Management ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-18)

Successfully implemented thread-safe session state management:

1. **Created SharedStateManager**: 
   - New class in `app/services/shared_state_manager.py`
   - Thread-safe per-session state management
   - Handles AI processing flags, backend triggers, and retry context
   - Session cleanup for expired sessions
   
2. **Updated GameOrchestrator**:
   - Removed shared state instance variables
   - Now uses SharedStateManager for all state management
   - All handler methods updated to accept session_id parameter
   
3. **Updated All Action Handlers**:
   - Added session_id parameter to all handler methods
   - State accessed through SharedStateManager
   - Thread-safe operation for concurrent requests
   
4. **API Routes Updated**:
   - Added session ID generation in `game_routes.py`
   - All endpoints now pass session_id to handlers
   - Uses Flask sessions for consistent session management
   
5. **Test Updates**:
   - All tests updated to use SharedStateManager
   - Fixed test setup to provide session IDs
   - All 901 tests passing (5 skipped)
   
**Architecture Benefits**:
- Thread-safe concurrent request handling
- Proper session isolation
- Clear state management boundaries
- No more shared mutable state on singletons

2. **API Route Consolidation**
   - Consolidate `d5e_routes.py` (749 lines, 41 endpoints) into logical groups:
     - Use query parameters instead of separate endpoints (e.g., `/api/d5e/content?type=spells&school=evocation`)
     - Reduce to ~10 flexible endpoints total
     - Move complex filtering logic to the service layer
   - Split remaining routes into focused blueprints:
     - `combat_routes.py` - Combat-specific endpoints
     - `reference_routes.py` - D&D reference data
     - `content_management_routes.py` - Content pack management

3. **DRY Service Getters**
   - Create `app/api/dependencies.py` with dependency injection decorators:
     ```python
     @inject_service(ContentService)
     def get_spells(service: ContentService):
         # service is automatically injected
     ```
   - Remove all duplicate `get_*_service()` functions from route files
   - Create shared error handler utility in `app/api/error_handlers.py`

4. **Response Processor Refactoring**
    - Split `response_processor.py` (579 lines) by responsibility:
      - Extract handler pattern to separate files
      - Create focused processors: `NarrativeProcessor`, `CombatProcessor`, `StateProcessor`
      - Keep main processor as coordinator only

#### Phase 6.4: Dependency & Architecture Simplification (Week 4)

1. **GameOrchestrator Dependency Reduction**
    - Reduce constructor parameters from 8 to 3-4 using service aggregates:
      - Create `GameServices` aggregate containing combat, dice, character services
      - Create `NarrativeServices` aggregate containing AI, chat, RAG services
      - Keep only essential direct dependencies

2. **Event System Simplification (YAGNI)**
    - Evaluate which events truly need the full handler pattern
    - Convert simple event handlers to direct method calls where appropriate
    - Remove `SharedHandlerStateModel` if not providing clear value
    - Keep event system only for truly decoupled components

3. **Base Handler Decomposition**
    - Extract common logic from `base_handler.py` (594 lines) to utilities:
      - `handler_utils.py` - Common validation and error handling
      - `state_utils.py` - State manipulation helpers
      - `event_utils.py` - Event creation and publishing helpers
    - Keep base handler thin (under 100 lines)

4. **Configuration Flattening**
    - Identify rarely-changed nested configuration
    - Create sensible defaults to reduce configuration complexity
    - Merge related configuration classes where it makes sense
    - Document configuration with examples

### Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Content Service as Single Source of Truth**
   - All D&D 5e data accessed through ContentService
   - No direct JSON file access in the application
   - Content packs control all game content availability

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - `app/content/` - All D&D 5e content management
   - `app/models/` - Runtime game state models only
   - Clear boundary between static content and dynamic state

3. **Type Safety**
   - Use Pydantic models throughout (no TypedDict)
   - Generate TypeScript from Pydantic models
   - Maintain 100% type safety in both backend and frontend
