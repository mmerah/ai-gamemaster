# Database Migration Progress

## Current Status: Phase 5.5 Complete âœ… | Phase 5.6 Planned

### Phase 5.5: Content Management UI/UX - COMPLETE âœ…

#### Completion Summary (2025-06-16)

Phase 5.5 has been successfully completed with two major commits:

1. **Commit 638b04d**: Complete Phase 5.5 - Dual database architecture for content separation
2. **Commit e914025**: Complete content creation forms - Add all 16 missing content types

#### Major Achievements

##### 1. **Dual Database Architecture** âœ…
- **System Database** (`data/content.db`):
  - Read-only at SQLite connection level using `?mode=ro`
  - Contains only D&D 5e SRD content
  - Git tracked and shipped with repository
  - Never editable by users
- **User Database** (`data/user_content.db`):
  - Full read/write access for user content
  - Created on first use
  - Added to `.gitignore`
  - Successfully migrated test_custom_pack

##### 2. **Backend Architecture Improvements** âœ…
- Created `DatabaseManagerProtocol` interface for clean dependency injection
- Implemented `DualDatabaseManager` for transparent system/user DB access
- Data precedence rules: user content overrides system content
- All repositories now support dual database through protocol pattern
- Migration script successfully separates existing user content

##### 3. **Content Creation System - 100% Coverage** âœ…
- **JSON Upload**: All 25 content types have complete JSON examples
- **Form Creation**: All 25 content types have comprehensive form-based creation
- **Added 16 new content creation forms**:
  - Simple forms: alignments, ability-scores, damage-types, weapon-properties
  - Medium forms: languages, proficiencies, rules, equipment-categories
  - Complex forms: magic-schools, rule-sections, features, levels, magic-items
  - Advanced forms: subclasses, subraces, classes (with full D&D 5e structure)

##### 4. **Frontend Improvements** âœ…
- Fixed duplicate pack display issue in ContentManagerView
- Dynamic content type loading (all 25 types available)
- Added ContentPackDetailView with full routing
- Fixed "Total" option in content type dropdown
- Items are now clickable with detail modal view
- Upload button correctly hidden on system packs
- Form validation matches backend requirements

##### 5. **Type System Standardization** âœ…
- Unified all content types to hyphenated format (e.g., "ability-scores")
- Removed underscore-to-hyphen conversions in frontend
- Fixed TypeScript type definitions and error handling
- Updated all form validation and JSON generation

##### 6. **Security Enhancements** âœ…
- Input validation for all content operations
- File upload security (size limits, type validation)
- API security enhancements with proper validators
- SQL injection prevention in all queries

##### 7. **Testing & Quality** âœ…
- All 876 tests passing with RAG enabled
- 100% type safety maintained (0 mypy errors)
- Code formatting and linting complete
- Comprehensive documentation maintained

#### Technical Details of Final Implementation

**Content Pack Service** (`app/content/services/content_pack_service.py`):
- Enhanced with content item management methods
- Proper error handling and validation
- Support for all 25 content types

**API Routes** (`app/api/content_routes.py`):
- Complete CRUD operations for content items
- Content pack detail endpoint with pagination
- Proper error responses and validation

**Frontend Components**:
- `ContentCreationForm.vue`: 1965 lines covering all 25 content types
- `UploadContentModal.vue`: Enhanced with 485+ lines of JSON examples
- `ContentPackDetailView.vue`: Full content viewing with filtering

**Type Generation** (`scripts/dev/generate_ts.py`):
- Enhanced to generate complete D&D 5e TypeScript types
- Proper interface generation from Pydantic models
- Maintains type safety across frontend/backend

### Phase 5.6: D&D 5e Type System Refactoring (Ready to Start)

Based on the completed work in Phase 5.5, the following technical debt items are ready to be addressed in Phase 5.6:

#### Identified Issues for Phase 5.6
1. **Type System Usage**: D&D 5e types in `unified.ts` are generated but not actively used
   - `campaignStore` loads from API without type safety
   - `useD5eData.ts` uses untyped responses
   - Many components use `any` instead of proper D5e interfaces

2. **Content Type Naming**: Already standardized to hyphenated format in Phase 5.5
   - Frontend now uses hyphenated names natively
   - No more underscore conversions needed
   - This simplifies Phase 5.6 implementation

3. **Type Safety Gaps**:
   - Frontend services return untyped data
   - Stores use generic objects instead of D5e interfaces
   - Missing type guards for runtime validation

#### Phase 5.6 Implementation Ready
The groundwork from Phase 5.5 makes Phase 5.6 implementation straightforward:
- All content types are standardized
- Type generation is working correctly
- Frontend/backend communication is stable
- 100% test coverage maintained

### Phase 6: Cleanup and Security Hardening

#### Security Priorities (Not yet implemented)
- Add CSRF protection
- Implement rate limiting
- Add security headers (X-Frame-Options, CSP)
- Enhanced input sanitization

#### Code Cleanup (After Phase 5.6)
- Remove old JSON loading code
- Update documentation
- Performance optimizations
- Browser compatibility testing
