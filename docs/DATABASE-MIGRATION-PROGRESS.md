# Database Migration Progress

This document tracks the implementation progress of migrating from JSON-based data storage to SQLite with sqlite-vec extension.

> 📖 **For migration instructions, see [DATABASE-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md](DATABASE-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md)**

## Current Status: Phase 4 Complete ✅

### Migration Overview
- **Approach**: SQLite with sqlite-vec extension for vector search
- **Scope**: Migrate D&D 5e ruleset data only (game saves remain JSON)
- **Timeline**: 8 weeks estimated (including Phase 4.5 hardening)
- **Methodology**: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Prerequisites Complete ✅
The 5e-database JSON integration (Phases 1-7) has been completed, providing:
- Comprehensive Pydantic models for all 25 data types
- Repository pattern implementation
- Service layer abstraction
- Full API exposure
- RAG system integration

This foundation will make the database migration smoother as all data models and interfaces are already defined.

## Testing Strategy

### Test Requirements

- Performance benchmarks for startup time improvement
- Load testing for concurrent database access

### Test Execution
```bash
# Run after each task completion
python tests/run_all_tests.py --with-rag

# Type checking
mypy app --strict

# Linting
ruff check .
ruff format .
```

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy | Status |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| Data loss during migration | Backup JSON files, test migration script thoroughly | Planned |
| Performance regression | Benchmark before/after, optimize queries | Planned |
| Breaking API changes | Maintain exact method signatures in repositories | Planned |
| Vector search accuracy | Compare results with current RAG system | Planned |

## Performance Targets

- **Startup Time**: < 1 second (from 30-60 seconds)
- **Memory Usage**: < 100MB (from ~1GB with all JSON loaded)
- **API Response**: < 50ms for cached queries
- **Vector Search**: < 100ms for semantic queries
