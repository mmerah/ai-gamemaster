# Database Migration Progress

## Current Status: Phase 5.5 Complete ✅

### Session Progress Update

#### Backend Changes Completed:
1. ✅ Created `DualDatabaseManager` class for dual database support
2. ✅ Updated `DatabaseSettings` to include `user_url` for user database
3. ✅ Updated `.env.example` with `USER_DATABASE_URL` setting
4. ✅ Added `data/user_content.db` to `.gitignore`
5. ✅ Modified `ServiceContainer` to use `DualDatabaseManager`
6. ✅ Updated `ContentPackRepository` to query both databases

#### Frontend Fixes Completed:
1. ✅ Fixed duplicate pack display issue (removed manual push in `handlePackCreated`)
2. ✅ Updated content types loading to use API (`loadSupportedTypes`)
3. ✅ Updated `CONTENT_TYPES` to include all 25 types
4. ✅ Added content type format conversion (underscore ↔ hyphen)

#### Current Blockers:
- Type compatibility issues: Components expecting `DatabaseManager` receiving `DualDatabaseManager`
- Need to update all repositories and services to handle dual database
- Migration script needed for existing user content

### Gemini Architecture Review Findings

#### Key Issues Identified:
1. **Union Type Anti-Pattern**: Using `Union[DatabaseManager, DualDatabaseManager]` violates Liskov Substitution Principle ✅ Fixed
2. **ID Collision Risk**: Same pack IDs could exist in both databases ✅ Handled with precedence
3. ~~**Copy-on-Write Missing**: Users can't modify system content~~ → **Clarification**: System content should NEVER be editable
4. **Read-Only Not Enforced**: System DB protection only in Python code ✅ Fixed with ?mode=ro

#### Implemented Architecture:

1. **Single Interface Pattern**: ✅
   - Created DatabaseManagerProtocol interface
   - Both DatabaseManager and DualDatabaseManager implement it
   - Repositories use protocol, not concrete types

2. **Data Precedence Rules**: ✅
   - User data overrides system data
   - get_by_id: Check user DB first, then system
   - get_all: Merge with user packs overwriting system duplicates

3. **No Copy-on-Write**: ✅
   - System content is read-only and cannot be edited
   - Users create their own content in user DB
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. **SQLite Read-Only Mode**: ✅
   - System DB uses `sqlite:///data/content.db?mode=ro`
   - Enforces read-only at connection level

5. **Migration Strategy**:
   - Backup original content.db
   - Identify user content (only `test_custom_pack`)
   - Move to user_content.db
   - System DB already clean (only contains SRD)

### Overview
- **Phases 1-4**: ✅ Complete (Database foundation, repositories, services, RAG)
- **Phase 5**: ✅ Backend complete, ⚠️ Frontend has critical issues
- **Phase 5.5**: 🚧 Frontend fixes and user content separation
- **Phase 6**: Pending (Cleanup and finalization)

## Phase 5.5: Critical Frontend Fixes & User Content Separation

### Critical Issue: User Content Storage 🚨

**Problem**: All content packs (system and user) are stored in `data/content.db`, which is tracked in git. This means:
- User's custom content would be committed to the repository
- Other users would get everyone's custom content when cloning
- Privacy and data ownership concerns

### Solution: Dual Database Architecture ✅

**Implementation Plan**:

1. **System Database** (`data/content.db`) - Git tracked
   - Contains only D&D 5e SRD content (dnd_5e_srd pack)
   - Read-only from application perspective (enforced via SQLite ?mode=ro)
   - Shipped with repository
   - NEVER editable by users

2. **User Database** (`data/user_content.db`) - Git ignored
   - Contains all user-created content packs
   - Created on first use
   - Full read/write access
   - Added to `.gitignore`
   - Currently needs migration of `test_custom_pack`

3. **Database Manager Updates**:
   ```python
   class DatabaseManager:
       def __init__(self, system_db_url: str, user_db_url: str):
           self.system_engine = create_engine(system_db_url)
           self.user_engine = create_engine(user_db_url)
       
       def get_session(self, for_user_content: bool = False) -> Session:
           engine = self.user_engine if for_user_content else self.system_engine
           return Session(engine)
   ```

4. **Repository Layer Updates**:
   - Query both databases when searching for content
   - Write operations only go to user database
   - Priority system remains unchanged (user content can override system)

5. **Migration Strategy**:
   - Detect existing user packs in `content.db`
   - Migrate them to `user_content.db` on first run
   - Maintain backwards compatibility

### Frontend Fixes Required

1. **Duplicate Pack Display** (Critical)
   - Remove push from `ContentManagerView.handlePackCreated()`
   - Let store be single source of truth

2. **Content Type Loading** (High)
   - Call `/api/content/supported-types` on component mount
   - Replace hardcoded 9 types with dynamic 25 types

3. **Upload Error** (Medium)
   - Fix undefined property access in upload handler
   - Add proper error handling

4. **Content Viewing** (High)
   - Create ContentPackDetailView component
   - Add route `/content/:packId`
   - Display pack contents with search/filter

5. **Upload UX** (Medium)
   - Add JSON format examples
   - Show required fields
   - Real-time validation

## Summary

Phase 5.5a is complete with significant architectural improvements:

### Completed in Phase 5.5a:
- ✅ Designed dual database architecture solution
- ✅ Created DatabaseManagerProtocol interface
- ✅ Implemented DualDatabaseManager with full protocol support
- ✅ Refactored all repositories to use DatabaseManagerProtocol
- ✅ Removed Union types and conditionals from ContentPackRepository
- ✅ Implemented data precedence rules (user overrides system)
- ✅ Enforced read-only mode for system DB at connection level
- ✅ Fixed frontend duplicate pack display bug
- ✅ Implemented dynamic content type loading (all 25 types)
- ✅ Added content type format conversion
- ✅ Updated all tests to work with new architecture
- ✅ All tests passing (876 total, 0 failures)

### User Observations & Clarifications:
1. **No Copy-on-Write Needed**: System content should remain completely read-only. Users cannot and should not edit system content.
2. **Current Database State**: content.db contains:
   - `dnd_5e_srd` pack (system content) 
   - `test_custom_pack` (user-created, but empty)
3. **Maintainability Check**: Need to verify the solution isn't over-engineered

### Completed in Phase 5.5b:
1. ✅ **Migration Script**: Successfully created and ran migration script
   - Moved `test_custom_pack` from content.db to user_content.db
   - Includes dry-run mode, backups, and verification
   - Full type safety with 0 mypy errors
2. ✅ **Frontend Issues**: All resolved
   - Fixed JavaScript upload error (error handling and type definitions)
   - Added ContentPackDetailView with routing
   - Improved user experience with "View" button on content packs
3. ✅ **Testing**: Comprehensive testing completed
   - 876 tests passing
   - Type checking clean
   - Code formatting and linting complete

### Remaining Work for Phase 6:
1. **Documentation**: Update architecture docs with new dual DB design
2. **API Enhancement**: Implement content viewing API endpoints (currently shows stats only)
3. **Upload UX**: Add JSON format examples and real-time validation

### Maintainability Verification Checklist: ✅ COMPLETED

*Phase 5.5 completed on 2025-06-15*

---

## Phase 5.5 Post-Completion Issues Found

### Critical Issues Identified (2025-06-15)

1. **Upload Button Available on System Pack** 🚨
   - **Issue**: The "Upload" button is visible on the 5e SRD system pack
   - **Root Cause**: `ContentPackCard.vue` doesn't check `isSystemPack` for Upload button visibility
   - **Impact**: Users can attempt to upload content to read-only system pack
   - **Fix Required**: Add `v-if="!isSystemPack"` to Upload button (similar to Delete button)

2. **Invalid JSON Example in Upload Modal** ⚠️
   - **Issue**: Placeholder JSON contains ellipsis (...) which is invalid JSON
   - **Current State**: 
     ```json
     [{"name": "Fireball", "level": 3, "school": "evocation", ...}]
     ```
   - **Impact**: Users copying the example will get JSON parse errors
   - **Fix Required**: 
     - Provide complete, valid JSON examples for each content type
     - Different examples based on selected content type
     - Consider form-based input as an option that users can use instead of raw JSON

3. **Content Viewing Shows 0 Elements** 🔴
   - **Issue**: ContentPackDetailView always shows 0 items, even for system pack
   - **Root Cause**: No API endpoint to fetch content items for a pack
   - **Current State**:
     - Frontend ready to display items but `contentItems` hardcoded to `[]`
     - Backend missing `/api/content/packs/{pack_id}/content` endpoint
     - Only statistics endpoint exists, not actual content retrieval
   - **Fix Required**: 
     - Implement backend endpoint to fetch pack content items
     - Add pagination/filtering support for large packs
     - Wire up frontend to use new endpoint

### Additional Findings

1. **Content Type Format Inconsistency**:
   - Frontend uses underscores: `ability_scores`
   - Backend expects hyphens: `ability-scores`
   - Conversion handled in multiple places (potential for bugs)

2. **Upload Implementation Incomplete**:
   - Backend validation works but actual database insertion marked as TODO
   - `content_routes.py` line 257: Database insertion not implemented

### Recommended Priority for Phase 6

1. **High Priority**:
   - Hide Upload button on system packs
   - Implement content viewing API endpoint
   - Complete upload database insertion

2. **Medium Priority**:
   - Improve JSON examples with complete, valid samples
   - Add form-based content creation option
   - Standardize content type naming (underscore vs hyphen)

3. **Low Priority**:
   - Add bulk operations support
   - Implement content export functionality
   - Add content versioning/history
