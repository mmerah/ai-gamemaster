### Phase 6: Architecture Consistency & Clean Code (Revised)

#### Phase 6.1: Core Refactoring (Week 1) ✅ **COMPLETE**

1. **Repository Pattern Standardization** ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-17) ✅ **VERIFIED** (2025-06-17)
   - Created ABC interfaces for all repositories in `app/core/repository_interfaces.py`
   - Unified repository method naming:
     - `get_template/get_instance` → `get`
     - `save_template/save_instance` → `save`
     - `delete_template/delete_instance` → `delete`
     - `list_templates/list_all_instances` → `list`
     - `list_instances_for_template` → `list_by_template`
     - `list_templates_for_campaign` → `list_by_campaign`
   - Updated all repositories with new method names (backward compatibility maintained)
   - Updated all API routes and services to use new method names

2. **CampaignFactory Creation** ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-17) ✅ **VERIFIED WITH FIXES** (2025-06-17)
   - Created `app/domain/campaigns/factories.py` with CampaignFactory class
   - Extracted campaign instance creation logic from CampaignService
   - Implemented methods:
     - `create_campaign_instance` - Creates campaign instance from template
     - `create_initial_game_state` - Creates initial game state for new campaign
     - `create_game_state_from_instance` - Creates game state from existing instance
     - `create_template_preview_state` - Creates preview state for templates
     - `_merge_content_packs` - Handles content pack priority merging
   - Updated CampaignService to use factory for all creation logic
   - Updated ServiceContainer to provide both CharacterFactory and CampaignFactory
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for CampaignFactory
   - Updated existing CampaignService tests to work with factory pattern
   - Fixed factory coupling issue: CampaignService now takes CharacterFactory directly
   - All tests passing (878 passed, 1 skipped)

3. **Service Layer Splitting** ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-17) ✅ **VERIFIED WITH FIXES** (2025-06-17)
   - Split GameOrchestrator into focused services:
     - `CombatOrchestrationService` - Handles all combat-specific orchestration
     - `NarrativeOrchestrationService` - Manages narrative and chat flow
     - `EventRoutingService` - Routes events and manages shared concerns
   - GameOrchestrator now acts as a thin coordination layer
   - All handlers properly encapsulated within their respective services
   - **YAGNI Cleanup**: Removed 10 unused methods from orchestration services:
     - CombatOrchestrationService: `validate_player_turn`, `get_npc_turn_instructions`, `advance_combat_turn`, `is_combat_active`
     - NarrativeOrchestrationService: `get_rag_context`, `format_scene_description`, `build_narrative_context`, `should_add_narrative_flourish`
     - EventRoutingService: `set_ai_processing`, `set_needs_backend_trigger` (only used in tests)
   - **Type Safety**: Improved shared context implementation
   - **Naming Consistency**: All orchestration services follow consistent naming pattern
   - **Integration Test Fix**: Fixed shared retry context to work across all handlers in Flask integration tests
   - Fixed all mypy type errors (0 errors)
   - All tests passing (879 passed, 1 skipped)

#### Phase 6.2: Model & Event Improvements (Week 2) - IN PROGRESS

1. **Model Reorganization** ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-17) ✅ **VERIFIED** (2025-06-17)
   - Split large model files into logical sub-packages:
     - **character.py** (372 lines) → `character/` sub-package:
       - `template.py`: CharacterTemplateModel (static data)
       - `instance.py`: CharacterInstanceModel (dynamic state)
       - `combined.py`: CombinedCharacterModel (DTO)
       - `utils.py`: CharacterModifierDataModel, CharacterData
     - **events.py** (306 lines) → `events/` sub-package:
       - `base.py`: BaseGameEvent
       - `narrative.py`: Narrative events
       - `combat.py`: Combat and combatant events
       - `dice.py`: Dice roll events
       - `game_state.py`: Location, party, quest events
       - `system.py`: System events (processing, errors, snapshots)
       - `utils.py`: Utility models
     - **combat.py** (300 lines) → `combat/` sub-package:
       - `attack.py`: AttackModel
       - `combatant.py`: CombatantModel, InitialCombatantData
       - `state.py`: CombatStateModel, NextCombatantInfoModel
       - `response.py`: CombatInfoResponseModel (DTO)
   - Maintained backward compatibility with deprecation warnings
   - All imports re-exported through package __init__.py files
   - Type checking passes (mypy --strict: 0 errors)
   - All tests passing (882 passed, 1 skipped)
   - Verified 2025-06-17: All changes working correctly, original files reduced from ~300-370 lines to ~25-28 lines (deprecation warnings only)

2. **Event System Refactoring** ❌ **ABANDONED** (2025-06-17)
    - Started implementing EventBus pattern but determined it added complexity without value
    - Current event system works adequately for the application's needs
    - Better to focus on actual business logic improvements

3. **Additional Factories** ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-17) ✅ **VERIFIED WITH INTEGRATION** (2025-06-17)
   - `CombatFactory` - Creates combat states and combatants
   - `QuestFactory` - Creates quests and objectives  
   - `NPCFactory` - Creates NPCs with consistent structure
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for all factories
   - Type-safe implementation with mypy --strict compliance
   - Integrated into ServiceContainer
   - **Integration Status**:
     - CombatFactory: Successfully integrated into CombatService
       - Moved all combatant creation logic from CombatService to factory
       - CombatService.start_combat reduced from ~50 lines to ~10 lines
       - Factory handles both PC and NPC combatant creation with proper initiative
       - Made factory helper methods private for clean public interface
     - QuestFactory: Created but not integrated (quests managed via AI responses)
     - NPCFactory: Created but not integrated (NPCs managed via AI responses)
   - **Code Quality**: Fixed private method usage based on Gemini review
   - **Note**: AC calculation simplified (10 + DEX modifier) - proper equipment-based calculation would require ContentService integration
   - All tests passing (915 passed, 1 skipped)

#### Phase 6.3: Service & API Cleanup (Week 3) - IN PROGRESS

1. **State Processor Decomposition** ✅ **COMPLETE** (2025-06-17) ✅ **VERIFIED WITH CLEANUP** (2025-06-17)
   - Split `app/domain/game_model/state_processors.py` (1093 lines) into focused processors:
     - `CombatStateProcessor` (269 lines) - Core combat state management (start, end, remove)
     - `CombatHPProcessor` (180 lines) - HP change handling
     - `CombatConditionProcessor` (198 lines) - Condition add/remove handling
     - `CombatHelpers` (176 lines) - Combat setup helper functions
     - `InventoryStateProcessor` (243 lines) - Inventory and gold management
     - `QuestStateProcessor` (85 lines) - Quest update handling
     - `utils.py` (41 lines) - Shared utilities (get_correlation_id, get_target_ids_for_update)
   - **Backward Compatibility Cleanup** (2025-06-17):
     - Removed backward compatibility wrapper (`state_processors.py`)
     - Updated `response_processor.py` to import directly from processors
     - Fixed test imports in `test_state_processors_combat_end.py`
   - **Architecture Benefits**:
     - All files under 300 lines as required
     - Clear separation of concerns
     - No backward compatibility debt
     - All 915 tests passing
     - Type safety maintained (mypy --strict: 0 errors)
   - **Gemini Review (2025-06-17)**:
     - "This is a model refactoring. Well done."
     - Excellent adherence to KISS, YAGNI, DRY, and SOLID principles
     - Massive improvement in Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
     - Future consideration: Move from static methods to dependency injection

2. **API Route Consolidation**
   - Consolidate `d5e_routes.py` (749 lines, 41 endpoints) into logical groups:
     - Use query parameters instead of separate endpoints (e.g., `/api/d5e/content?type=spells&school=evocation`)
     - Reduce to ~10 flexible endpoints total
     - Move complex filtering logic to the service layer
   - Split remaining routes into focused blueprints:
     - `combat_routes.py` - Combat-specific endpoints
     - `reference_routes.py` - D&D reference data
     - `content_management_routes.py` - Content pack management

3. **DRY Service Getters**
   - Create `app/api/dependencies.py` with dependency injection decorators:
     ```python
     @inject_service(ContentService)
     def get_spells(service: ContentService):
         # service is automatically injected
     ```
   - Remove all duplicate `get_*_service()` functions from route files
   - Create shared error handler utility in `app/api/error_handlers.py`

4. **Response Processor Refactoring**
    - Split `response_processor.py` (579 lines) by responsibility:
      - Extract handler pattern to separate files
      - Create focused processors: `NarrativeProcessor`, `CombatProcessor`, `StateProcessor`
      - Keep main processor as coordinator only

#### Phase 6.4: Dependency & Architecture Simplification (Week 4)

1. **GameOrchestrator Dependency Reduction**
    - Reduce constructor parameters from 8 to 3-4 using service aggregates:
      - Create `GameServices` aggregate containing combat, dice, character services
      - Create `NarrativeServices` aggregate containing AI, chat, RAG services
      - Keep only essential direct dependencies

2. **Event System Simplification (YAGNI)**
    - Evaluate which events truly need the full handler pattern
    - Convert simple event handlers to direct method calls where appropriate
    - Remove `SharedHandlerStateModel` if not providing clear value
    - Keep event system only for truly decoupled components

3. **Base Handler Decomposition**
    - Extract common logic from `base_handler.py` (594 lines) to utilities:
      - `handler_utils.py` - Common validation and error handling
      - `state_utils.py` - State manipulation helpers
      - `event_utils.py` - Event creation and publishing helpers
    - Keep base handler thin (under 100 lines)

4. **Configuration Flattening**
    - Identify rarely-changed nested configuration
    - Create sensible defaults to reduce configuration complexity
    - Merge related configuration classes where it makes sense
    - Document configuration with examples

### Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Content Service as Single Source of Truth**
   - All D&D 5e data accessed through ContentService
   - No direct JSON file access in the application
   - Content packs control all game content availability

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - `app/content/` - All D&D 5e content management
   - `app/models/` - Runtime game state models only
   - Clear boundary between static content and dynamic state

3. **Type Safety**
   - Use Pydantic models throughout (no TypedDict)
   - Generate TypeScript from Pydantic models
   - Maintain 100% type safety in both backend and frontend
