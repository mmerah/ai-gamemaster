### Technical Considerations

1. **Priority Resolution Logic**:
   ```python
   # In repositories, iterate through priority list
   for pack_id in content_pack_priority:
       entity = query.filter(content_pack_id=pack_id).first()
       if entity:
           return entity
   ```

2. **Upload Validation**:
   - Validate JSON against Pydantic models
   - Return detailed validation errors
   - Support bulk uploads with partial success

3. **Vector Indexing**:
   - Generate embeddings after upload
   - Update existing `_embedding` columns
   - Consider background job queue for large uploads

4. **Security**:
   - Prevent SQL injection (already done in Phase 4.5)
   - Validate content pack IDs
   - Rate limit upload endpoints

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each new component
- Integration tests for priority system
- End-to-end tests for upload flow
- Performance tests for large content packs

### Key Module Locations
- **Database Models**: `app/content/models.py`
- **Base Repository**: `app/content/repositories/db_base_repository.py`
- **ContentService**: `app/content/service.py`
- **API Routes**: `app/api/content_routes.py`
- **Content Pack Services**: `app/content/services/`
- **Frontend**: `frontend/src/` (to be created)

## Code Quality & Architecture

### Pre-commit Compliance
All files created follow:
- Ruff formatting standards ✅
- Mypy type checking (strict mode) ✅
- No import sorting issues ✅
- Proper docstrings and type annotations ✅

### Architecture Principles
1. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between API, service, repository, and model layers
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services get dependencies injected through constructors
3. **Type Safety**: 100% type-safe with mypy strict mode passing
4. **DRY**: Reusable base repository pattern, shared validation logic
5. **SOLID**: Single responsibility for each service/repository

### Key Design Decisions
1. **Separate Repository for ContentPack**: Since ContentPack doesn't inherit from BaseContent, it has its own repository pattern
2. **Service Layer**: ContentPackService handles business logic, keeping repositories focused on data access
3. **Modular Services**: IndexingService is separate for single responsibility
4. **RESTful API**: Following existing patterns with proper error handling and status codes
5. **Content Pack Inheritance**: Campaign instances merge content packs from campaign templates and character templates
6. **GameState Integration**: Added content_pack_priority to GameStateModel for universal access

### Recent Improvements (Completed)

#### Gemini Review Implementation (Current Session)
1. **DRY Principle**: Created `app/content/content_types.py` to centralize content type mappings
   - Eliminates duplication between ContentPackService and IndexingService
   - Single source of truth for content type to model/entity mappings

2. **Repository Hub Integration**: 
   - Added ContentPackRepository to D5eDbRepositoryHub for unified access
   - Maintains consistency with existing repository pattern

3. **Content Pack Priority System**:
   - Extended ContentService key methods with `content_pack_priority` parameter
   - Added `_with_options` methods to base repository for content pack filtering
   - Updated DbSpellRepository with `get_by_class_with_options`
   - Added `search_all_with_options` to D5eDbRepositoryHub

4. **Model Updates**:
   - Added `content_pack_ids` to CharacterTemplateModel
   - Added `content_pack_ids` to CampaignTemplateModel
   - Added `content_pack_priority` to GameStateModel
   - Added `content_pack_priority` to CampaignInstanceModel

5. **Content Pack Inheritance**:
   - Implemented `_merge_content_packs` in CampaignService
   - Campaign instances now merge packs from templates and characters
   - Priority order: Campaign > Characters > System default

6. **Type Safety**: 
   - Fixed all import and type errors
   - Maintains mypy strict mode compliance (0 errors)
   - Updated TypeScript definitions

   - Fixed: `calculate_spell_save_dc` test to mock correct method (no priority support)
   - All ContentService tests now passing (17/17 in test_content_service.py)

### Issues Found and Fixed During Testing:
1. **File organization**:
   - Moved `test_content_pack_api.py` from `tests/integration/` to `tests/integration/api/`
   - Moved `test_service_priority.py` from `tests/unit/content/` to `tests/unit/content/services/`
   - Moved and renamed `test_service.py` to `tests/unit/content/services/test_content_service.py`
   - Maintains consistent directory structure: service tests go in `services/` subdirectory
2. **Circular import** between types.py and content_pack.py
   - Removed ContentStatistics type alias, use Dict[str, int] directly
3. **Mock setup issues**:
   - Fixed query chain mocking for SQLAlchemy patterns
   - Added proper attributes to mock objects for Pydantic validation
4. **API compatibility issues**:
   - DuplicateEntityError requires entity_type and identifier parameters

   - Added type annotations to avoid mypy errors
   - Fixed ndarray type parameters for numpy arrays
6. **Pre-commit compliance**:
   - All tests pass ruff check and ruff format
   - mypy --strict shows no errors (100% type-safe)
7. **Legacy test compatibility**:
   - ContentService methods updated to support content_pack_priority parameter
   - Existing tests updated to use new `_with_options` method variants
   - Backwards compatibility maintained for methods without priority

### Architectural Review Findings (Gemini AI)

#### Key Strengths Identified:
1. **Clean Architecture**: Excellent separation of concerns (API, Service, Repository)
2. **Type Safety**: 100% type-safe with mypy strict mode
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests
4. **Error Handling**: Custom exceptions for all error cases
5. **System Protection**: SRD pack cannot be deleted/deactivated

#### Critical Improvements Needed:

1. **Priority Resolution Documentation**:
   - Document exact chain of priority: GameState > CampaignInstance > Default
   - Define merge strategy (shallow vs deep, overwrite vs concatenate)
   - Add explicit tests for complex priority scenarios

2. **Security Hardening**:
   - **File Upload Validation**: Add MIME type checks, file size limits
   - **Authorization**: Implement user ownership checks (IDOR prevention)
   - **Role-Based Access**: Define User vs Admin roles
   - **Content Sanitization**: Prevent XSS in uploaded content

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - **Async Indexing**: Move IndexingService to background tasks
   - **Add Status Field**: Track pack states (uploading, indexing, active)
   - **Database Indexes**: Add indexes for new foreign key fields
   - **Cache Statistics**: Avoid recalculating on every request

4. **Code Improvements**:
   - Rename `_with_options` to more descriptive names
   - Extract `_merge_content_packs` to standalone class
   - Create exception hierarchy (ContentPackError base class)
   - Add feature flag until RAG integration complete

### Testing Recommendations:
1. **Edge Cases**:
   - Idempotency (activate already active pack)
   - Orphaned references (deleted pack in campaign)
   - Empty/null content indexing
   - Parametrize tests for all 25 content types

2. **Security Tests**:
   - Authorization (user can only modify own packs)
   - Malformed requests (oversized, invalid JSON)
   - SQL injection attempts
   - Rate limiting validation

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Query count assertions (prevent N+1)
   - Batch processing efficiency
   - Large dataset search performance

### Improvements from Gemini Review (Completed)

1. **SQL Query Clarification**: ✅
   - Verified that SQL CASE statement is dynamically generated based on priority order
   - Added comprehensive comments explaining the window function logic
   - Security is already handled via parameterized queries and table name whitelisting

2. **Performance Optimization**: ✅
   - Created new Alembic migration for composite indexes on (content_pack_id, name)
   - These indexes optimize the RAG vector search with content pack filtering

3. **API Parameter Clarity**: ✅
   - Renamed misleading variable names in API endpoints
   - Changed `content_pack_priority` to `content_pack_ids` where only filtering occurs
   - Added comments clarifying when filtering vs priority-based deduplication is used

4. **Code Documentation**: ✅
   - Added detailed comments to complex SQL window function
   - Explained the 6-step process of priority-based deduplication

### Frontend Architecture (Completed in Current Session)

#### Component Structure
1. **ContentManagerView.vue** - Main view with grid layout for content packs
2. **ContentPackCard.vue** - Reusable card component for individual packs
3. **CreatePackModal.vue** - Modal form for creating new content packs
4. **UploadContentModal.vue** - Interface for uploading JSON content with validation

#### State Management
- **contentStore.ts** - Centralized Pinia store for content pack state
- Proper separation of concerns: Components → Store → API Service
- Computed properties for filtered views (active/user/system packs)

#### Security Recommendations from Gemini Review
1. **Backend Validation**: All validation must be duplicated on backend (frontend validation is for UX only)
2. **XSS Prevention**: Never use v-html for user content; sanitize with DOMPurify if HTML rendering needed
3. **JSON Parsing**: Wrap JSON.parse in try-catch for graceful error handling
4. **State Consistency**: Update store state after CUD operations
5. **Loading States**: Implement proper loading/error states for all async operations

#### Performance Optimizations Suggested
1. **Lazy Loading**: ContentManagerView should be lazy-loaded in router
2. **Virtual Scrolling**: Consider for large numbers of content packs
3. **API Data Transformation**: Handle snake_case to camelCase in API service layer

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. **Phase 6**: Cleanup and finalization
2. **Security Hardening**: Implement Gemini's security recommendations
3. **Performance**: Add lazy loading for Content Manager route
4. **Optional**: Background task processing for large content pack uploads
5. **Optional**: Investigate vector indexes (HNSW/IVFFlat) for scale
