# Database Migration Progress

## Current Status: Phase 5.6 In Progress | Major Architecture Shift Identified

### Phase 5.5: Content Management UI/UX - COMPLETE âœ…

#### Completion Summary (2025-06-16)

Phase 5.5 has been successfully completed with two major commits:

1. **Commit 638b04d**: Complete Phase 5.5 - Dual database architecture for content separation
2. **Commit e914025**: Complete content creation forms - Add all 16 missing content types

#### Major Achievements

##### 1. **Dual Database Architecture** âœ…
- **System Database** (`data/content.db`):
  - Read-only at SQLite connection level using `?mode=ro`
  - Contains only D&D 5e SRD content
  - Git tracked and shipped with repository
  - Never editable by users
- **User Database** (`data/user_content.db`):
  - Full read/write access for user content
  - Created on first use
  - Added to `.gitignore`
  - Successfully migrated test_custom_pack

##### 2. **Backend Architecture Improvements** âœ…
- Created `DatabaseManagerProtocol` interface for clean dependency injection
- Implemented `DualDatabaseManager` for transparent system/user DB access
- Data precedence rules: user content overrides system content
- All repositories now support dual database through protocol pattern
- Migration script successfully separates existing user content

##### 3. **Content Creation System - 100% Coverage** âœ…
- **JSON Upload**: All 25 content types have complete JSON examples
- **Form Creation**: All 25 content types have comprehensive form-based creation
- **Added 16 new content creation forms**:
  - Simple forms: alignments, ability-scores, damage-types, weapon-properties
  - Medium forms: languages, proficiencies, rules, equipment-categories
  - Complex forms: magic-schools, rule-sections, features, levels, magic-items
  - Advanced forms: subclasses, subraces, classes (with full D&D 5e structure)

##### 4. **Frontend Improvements** âœ…
- Fixed duplicate pack display issue in ContentManagerView
- Dynamic content type loading (all 25 types available)
- Added ContentPackDetailView with full routing
- Fixed "Total" option in content type dropdown
- Items are now clickable with detail modal view
- Upload button correctly hidden on system packs
- Form validation matches backend requirements

##### 5. **Type System Standardization** âœ…
- Unified all content types to hyphenated format (e.g., "ability-scores")
- Removed underscore-to-hyphen conversions in frontend
- Fixed TypeScript type definitions and error handling
- Updated all form validation and JSON generation

##### 6. **Security Enhancements** âœ…
- Input validation for all content operations
- File upload security (size limits, type validation)
- API security enhancements with proper validators
- SQL injection prevention in all queries

##### 7. **Testing & Quality** âœ…
- All 876 tests passing with RAG enabled
- 100% type safety maintained (0 mypy errors)
- Code formatting and linting complete
- Comprehensive documentation maintained

### Phase 5.6: Type System Refactoring & State Management Cleanup (In Progress)

#### Major Architecture Shift Identified

During Phase 5.6 implementation, we discovered that the entire character and campaign system should be refactored to use the ContentService for ALL D&D 5e data access. This is a more comprehensive change than originally planned.

#### Revised Scope

Instead of just removing duplicate models, we need to:

1. **Complete Content Service Integration**
   - Remove ALL duplicate D&D 5e models from `app/models/utils.py`
   - Refactor character creation to use ContentService for:
     - Classes and subclasses
     - Races and subraces
     - Backgrounds
     - Alignments
     - Equipment and armor
     - All other D&D 5e reference data
   - Update CampaignService to use ContentService exclusively
   - Remove all JSON file loading code

2. **Benefits of This Approach**
   - Single source of truth for all D&D 5e data
   - Content pack system works for ALL character options
   - User-created content automatically available for character creation
   - Consistent data access patterns throughout the application
   - Better performance (database vs JSON parsing)

#### Completed Tasks in Phase 5.6

1. **Task 5.6.1: Delete D5EClassModel and ArmorModel** âœ…
   - Removed duplicate models from `app/models/utils.py`
   - These were simplified models that duplicated content schema functionality

2. **Task 5.6.2: Refactor CampaignService** âœ…
   - Updated to accept ContentService as dependency
   - Removed JSON loading methods (_load_d5e_data, _load_basic_armor_data)
   - Updated container to inject ContentService

3. **Task 5.6.3: Update CharacterFactory** âœ…
   - Refactored to use ContentService for class and equipment data
   - Added content_pack_priority support
   - Updated armor class and hit point calculations

4. **Task 5.6.4: Expand Content Service Usage** âœ… (2025-06-16)
   - Added missing ContentService methods (get_equipment_by_name, get_class_by_name, etc.)
   - Fixed CharacterFactory tests to use ContentService instead of removed models
   - Fixed ServiceContainer initialization order (ContentService before CampaignService)
   - Note: Updating character templates to use IDs instead of names deferred for backward compatibility

5. **Task 5.6.5: Document Backend Architecture** âœ… (2025-06-16)
   - Created app/models/README.md explaining model organization
   - Documented the separation between runtime models and content schemas
   - Explained DTO pattern (CombinedCharacterModel)
   - Added best practices and examples

#### Remaining Tasks in Phase 5.6

6. **Task 5.6.6: Add D&D 5e Content Validation** âœ… (2025-06-16)
   **Completed:**
   - Decided to keep string references for backward compatibility instead of switching to IDs
   - Added missing ContentService methods (get_equipment_by_name, get_class_by_name, get_race_by_name, get_subrace_by_name, get_background_by_name, get_alignment_by_name, get_subclass_by_name)
   - Fixed all CharacterFactory tests to use ContentService and mocks
   - Removed last JSON loading code from character_routes.py
   - Fixed test failures in character_adventures_route.py and test_unified_models_e2e.py
   - Created ContentValidator in `app/domain/validators/` with comprehensive validation logic
   - Maintained clean architecture by keeping ContentValidator out of the content module
   - Added 9 unit tests with full coverage
   - Integrated ContentValidator with ServiceContainer for dependency injection
   - Added validation methods to all required models:
     * CharacterTemplateModel: validate_content() method for all D&D 5e references
     * CharacterInstanceModel: validate_content() method for conditions
     * CampaignTemplateModel: validate_content() method for allowed_races, allowed_classes
     * ProficienciesModel: validate_content() method for all proficiencies
     * AttackModel: validate_content() method for damage_type
     * CombatantModel: validate_content() method for all conditions and damage types
   - Added helper methods to CharacterTemplateModel for fetching full D&D data (get_race_data(), get_class_data(), get_background_data())
   - All tests passing with RAG enabled (878 passed, 1 skipped)
   - Code passes all pre-commit checks (ruff, mypy --strict)

7. **Task 5.6.7: Enhance TypeScript Generation** (Previously 5.6.6)
   - Add content type constants from backend
   - Generate D&D content enums (Race, CharacterClass, etc.)
   - Improve organization of generated types
   - Add validation script

8. **Task 5.6.8: Remove ALL JSON Loading** (Previously 5.6.7)
   - Find and remove all JSON loading code
   - Update to use ContentService instead
   - Remove JSON data files after migration

9. **Task 5.6.9: Update Frontend for Content Integration** (Previously 5.6.8)
   - Update character creation UI to fetch from content API
   - Add API endpoints for available character options
   - Show content pack sources in UI

10. **Task 5.6.10: Frontend State Management** (Previously 5.6.9)
    - Remove duplicate state from gameStore
    - Ensure proper separation of concerns
    - Document store responsibilities

### Phase 6: Cleanup and Security Hardening

#### Updated Scope

1. **Complete JSON Removal**
   - Remove all JSON loading code from the codebase
   - Update documentation to reflect database-only approach
   - Remove JSON data files (keeping only for migration reference)

2. **Security Priorities**
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add security headers
   - Enhanced input sanitization

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize content queries with proper indexes
   - Add caching for frequently accessed content
   - Profile and optimize hot paths

4. **Architecture Consistency**
   - Create CampaignFactory to match CharacterFactory pattern
   - Move campaign creation logic from CampaignService to CampaignFactory
   - Benefits: Better separation of concerns, easier testing, consistent patterns
   - This will clean up the architecture by applying the same factory pattern used for characters

### Migration Timeline Summary

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1-4 | âœ… Complete | Database foundation, repositories, services, RAG |
| 5 | âœ… Complete | Backend API and initial frontend |
| 5.5 | âœ… Complete | Dual DB architecture, 100% content creation coverage |
| 5.6 | ðŸš§ In Progress | Type system refactoring & content service integration |
| 6 | ðŸ”œ Pending | Cleanup and security hardening |

### Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Content Service as Single Source of Truth**
   - All D&D 5e data accessed through ContentService
   - No direct JSON file access in the application
   - Content packs control all game content availability

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - `app/content/` - All D&D 5e content management
   - `app/models/` - Runtime game state models only
   - Clear boundary between static content and dynamic state

3. **Type Safety**
   - Use Pydantic models throughout (no TypedDict)
   - Generate TypeScript from Pydantic models
   - Maintain 100% type safety in both backend and frontend
