# Database Migration Progress

## Current Status: Phase 5.6 In Progress | Major Architecture Shift Identified

### Phase 5.5: Content Management UI/UX - COMPLETE âœ…

#### Completion Summary (2025-06-16)

Phase 5.5 has been successfully completed with two major commits:

1. **Commit 638b04d**: Complete Phase 5.5 - Dual database architecture for content separation
2. **Commit e914025**: Complete content creation forms - Add all 16 missing content types

#### Major Achievements

##### 1. **Dual Database Architecture** âœ…
- **System Database** (`data/content.db`):
  - Read-only at SQLite connection level using `?mode=ro`
  - Contains only D&D 5e SRD content
  - Git tracked and shipped with repository
  - Never editable by users
- **User Database** (`data/user_content.db`):
  - Full read/write access for user content
  - Created on first use
  - Added to `.gitignore`
  - Successfully migrated test_custom_pack

##### 2. **Backend Architecture Improvements** âœ…
- Created `DatabaseManagerProtocol` interface for clean dependency injection
- Implemented `DualDatabaseManager` for transparent system/user DB access
- Data precedence rules: user content overrides system content
- All repositories now support dual database through protocol pattern
- Migration script successfully separates existing user content

##### 3. **Content Creation System - 100% Coverage** âœ…
- **JSON Upload**: All 25 content types have complete JSON examples
- **Form Creation**: All 25 content types have comprehensive form-based creation
- **Added 16 new content creation forms**:
  - Simple forms: alignments, ability-scores, damage-types, weapon-properties
  - Medium forms: languages, proficiencies, rules, equipment-categories
  - Complex forms: magic-schools, rule-sections, features, levels, magic-items
  - Advanced forms: subclasses, subraces, classes (with full D&D 5e structure)

##### 4. **Frontend Improvements** âœ…
- Fixed duplicate pack display issue in ContentManagerView
- Dynamic content type loading (all 25 types available)
- Added ContentPackDetailView with full routing
- Fixed "Total" option in content type dropdown
- Items are now clickable with detail modal view
- Upload button correctly hidden on system packs
- Form validation matches backend requirements

##### 5. **Type System Standardization** âœ…
- Unified all content types to hyphenated format (e.g., "ability-scores")
- Removed underscore-to-hyphen conversions in frontend
- Fixed TypeScript type definitions and error handling
- Updated all form validation and JSON generation

##### 6. **Security Enhancements** âœ…
- Input validation for all content operations
- File upload security (size limits, type validation)
- API security enhancements with proper validators
- SQL injection prevention in all queries

##### 7. **Testing & Quality** âœ…
- All 876 tests passing with RAG enabled
- 100% type safety maintained (0 mypy errors)
- Code formatting and linting complete
- Comprehensive documentation maintained

### Phase 5.6: Type System Refactoring & State Management Cleanup - COMPLETE âœ… (2025-06-17)

#### Major Architecture Shift Completed

During Phase 5.6 implementation, we discovered and successfully executed a comprehensive refactoring where the entire character and campaign system now uses the ContentService for ALL D&D 5e data access. This was a more comprehensive change than originally planned but resulted in significant architectural improvements.

#### Completed Scope

We successfully completed all the following:

1. **Complete Content Service Integration** âœ…
   - Removed ALL duplicate D&D 5e models from `app/models/utils.py`
   - Refactored character creation to use ContentService for all D&D 5e reference data
   - Updated CampaignService to use ContentService exclusively
   - Removed all JSON file loading code

2. **Achieved Benefits**
   - Single source of truth for all D&D 5e data
   - Content pack system works for ALL character options
   - User-created content automatically available for character creation
   - Consistent data access patterns throughout the application
   - Better performance (database vs JSON parsing)

#### All Tasks in Phase 5.6 Completed

1. **Task 5.6.1: Delete D5EClassModel and ArmorModel** âœ…
   - Removed duplicate models from `app/models/utils.py`

2. **Task 5.6.2: Refactor CampaignService** âœ…
   - Updated to accept ContentService as dependency
   - Removed JSON loading methods

3. **Task 5.6.3: Update CharacterFactory** âœ…
   - Refactored to use ContentService for class and equipment data
   - Added content_pack_priority support

4. **Task 5.6.4: Expand Content Service Usage** âœ…
   - Added missing ContentService methods
   - Fixed all tests to use ContentService

5. **Task 5.6.5: Document Backend Architecture** âœ…
   - Created app/models/README.md explaining model organization

6. **Task 5.6.6: Add D&D 5e Content Validation** âœ…
   - Created ContentValidator with comprehensive validation logic
   - Added validation methods to all required models
   - All tests passing (878 passed, 1 skipped)

7. **Task 5.6.7: Enhance TypeScript Generation** âœ…
   - Enhanced generate_ts.py script with content type constants
   - Created validate_types.py script

8. **Task 5.6.8: Remove ALL JSON Loading** âœ…
   - Verified all D&D 5e content loading uses ContentService
   - Retained appropriate JSON usage for user data

9. **Task 5.6.9: Update Frontend for Content Integration** âœ… (2025-06-17)
   **Completed:**
   - Added `/api/character_templates/options` endpoint with content pack filtering
   - Supports both direct content_pack_ids and auto-detection from campaign_id
   - Returns races, classes, backgrounds with content pack source info
   - Updated frontend API service (campaignApi.ts) with getCharacterCreationOptions()
   - Enhanced campaignStore with loadCharacterCreationOptions() for backward compatibility
   - Modified useD5eData composable to support content pack filtering
   - Created ContentPackBadge.vue component for showing content sources
   - Maintained full backward compatibility while adding new features

10. **Task 5.6.10: Frontend State Management** âœ… (2025-06-17)
    **Completed:**
    - Removed duplicate state from gameStore (chatHistory, party, combatState, diceRequests)
    - All components already using specialized stores (verified)
    - Updated gameStore documentation to reflect new responsibilities
    - Clean separation of concerns achieved:
      * gameStore: Campaign-level state only
      * chatStore: All chat/narrative messages
      * partyStore: Party member state
      * combatStore: Combat state management
      * diceStore: Dice request handling
    - Removed all event handlers from gameStore (now handled by eventRouter)
    - All tests passing with RAG enabled (878 passed)
    - Code passes all quality checks (ruff, mypy --strict)

### Phase 6: Cleanup and Security Hardening

#### Updated Scope

1. **Complete JSON Removal**
   - Remove all JSON loading code from the codebase
   - Update documentation to reflect database-only approach
   - Remove JSON data files (keeping only for migration reference)

2. **Security Priorities**
   - Add CSRF protection
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add security headers
   - Enhanced input sanitization

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize content queries with proper indexes
   - Add caching for frequently accessed content
   - Profile and optimize hot paths

4. **Architecture Consistency**
   - Create CampaignFactory to match CharacterFactory pattern
   - Move campaign creation logic from CampaignService to CampaignFactory
   - Benefits: Better separation of concerns, easier testing, consistent patterns
   - This will clean up the architecture by applying the same factory pattern used for characters

### Migration Timeline Summary

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1-4 | âœ… Complete | Database foundation, repositories, services, RAG |
| 5 | âœ… Complete | Backend API and initial frontend |
| 5.5 | âœ… Complete | Dual DB architecture, 100% content creation coverage |
| 5.6 | ðŸš§ In Progress | Type system refactoring & content service integration |
| 6 | ðŸ”œ Pending | Cleanup and security hardening |

### Key Architecture Decisions

1. **Content Service as Single Source of Truth**
   - All D&D 5e data accessed through ContentService
   - No direct JSON file access in the application
   - Content packs control all game content availability

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - `app/content/` - All D&D 5e content management
   - `app/models/` - Runtime game state models only
   - Clear boundary between static content and dynamic state

3. **Type Safety**
   - Use Pydantic models throughout (no TypedDict)
   - Generate TypeScript from Pydantic models
   - Maintain 100% type safety in both backend and frontend
