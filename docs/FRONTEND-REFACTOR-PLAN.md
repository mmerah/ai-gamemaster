# Frontend Refactor & Redesign Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to refactor the frontend codebase for the AI Game Master. The primary goals are to improve the visual design, establish a consistent and maintainable design system, and enhance the overall code quality and architecture.

## Verification Status

**Last Verified:** December 26, 2024  
**Phase 0 Completed:** December 26, 2024  
**Phase 1 Completed:** December 27, 2024  
**Phase 2 Completed:** December 27, 2024

✅ **Plan Validity:** All phases have been verified and the plan is sound. The refactor will:
- Eliminate significant code duplication (especially in modals with 80%+ duplicate code)
- Improve maintainability through component abstraction
- Enable theme support (light/dark modes)
- Align with project's KISS, DRY, and SOLID principles

**Key Findings:**
- 191 occurrences of `fantasy-*` classes to be replaced with components
- 4 modal components with significant duplication
- No base component library exists
- Connection status logic in App.vue (~70 lines) should be extracted
- Prettier not installed for code formatting
- CSS variables not used in Tailwind config (needed for theming)

**Guiding Principles:**

-   **No Functional Changes:** All business logic within Pinia stores and services will remain untouched. This refactor is purely for presentation and frontend code structure.
-   **Minimalism & Premium Feel:** We will blend a clean, macOS-inspired aesthetic (whitespace, rounded corners, smooth transitions) with a premium fantasy theme (typography, color palette, subtle textures).
-   **Modularity & Reusability (DRY):** We will create a library of base components to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application and reduce code duplication.
-   **Consistency:** All views and components will adhere to the new design system and coding standards.

The refactor is divided into four main phases, designed to be completed sequentially.

---

## Phase 0: Foundation and Tooling

This phase establishes the bedrock for the redesign. We will define our design system in code and enhance our development tooling to enforce quality and consistency from the start.

### Task 0.1: Establish the Design System in Tailwind CSS [✓]

**Goal:** Define a comprehensive and theme-able design system in `tailwind.config.js` to serve as the single source of truth for all styling. This will enable easy implementation of light/dark modes.

**Current Status:** Tailwind is configured with fantasy colors but NOT using CSS variables. This task is essential for theme support.

**File to Modify:** `frontend/tailwind.config.js`

**Steps:**

1.  **CSS Variables for Theming:** Introduce CSS variables for colors to allow easy switching between light (parchment) and dark themes.
    -   In `frontend/src/styles/main.css`, define the color variables within `:root` (for light mode) and a `.dark` class (for dark mode).

    ```css
    /* In frontend/src/styles/main.css */
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;

    :root {
      --color-background: 244 241 232; /* parchment */
      --color-foreground: 29 25 22;   /* almost-black text */
      --color-primary: 96 72 48;      /* fantasy-brown */
      --color-primary-foreground: 255 255 255;
      --color-accent: 212 175 55;      /* gold */
      --color-accent-foreground: 29 25 22;
      --color-card: 248 245 238;       /* lighter parchment */
      --color-border: 212 175 55;      /* gold */
    }

    .dark {
      --color-background: 29 25 22;    /* almost-black */
      --color-foreground: 232 226 208; /* off-white text */
      --color-primary: 212 175 55;     /* gold */
      --color-primary-foreground: 29 25 22;
      --color-accent: 139 92 246;      /* purple accent */
      --color-accent-foreground: 255 255 255;
      --color-card: 41 37 36;          /* dark gray */
      --color-border: 96 72 48;       /* fantasy-brown */
    }
    ```

2.  **Update Tailwind Config:** Modify `frontend/tailwind.config.js` to use these CSS variables. This makes Tailwind aware of our theme.

    ```javascript
    // In frontend/tailwind.config.js
    theme: {
      extend: {
        colors: {
          background: 'rgb(var(--color-background) / <alpha-value>)',
          foreground: 'rgb(var(--color-foreground) / <alpha-value>)',
          primary: {
            DEFAULT: 'rgb(var(--color-primary) / <alpha-value>)',
            foreground: 'rgb(var(--color-primary-foreground) / <alpha-value>)',
          },
          accent: {
            DEFAULT: 'rgb(var(--color-accent) / <alpha-value>)',
            foreground: 'rgb(var(--color-accent-foreground) / <alpha-value>)',
          },
          card: 'rgb(var(--color-card) / <alpha-value>)',
          border: 'rgb(var(--color-border) / <alpha-value>)',
        },
        borderRadius: {
          lg: '0.75rem',
          md: '0.5rem',
          sm: '0.25rem',
        },
        // ... any other theme extensions like spacing or shadows
      },
    },
    ```

### Task 0.2: Enhance Linting and Formatting [✓]

**Goal:** Enforce stricter code quality and a consistent format across all frontend files.

**Current Status:** ESLint is well-configured but Prettier is NOT installed. This task will add automatic code formatting.

**Files to Modify:** `frontend/.eslintrc.json`, `frontend/package.json`, `/.pre-commit-config.yaml`

**Steps:**

1.  **Install Prettier:** Add Prettier for consistent code formatting.
    ```bash
    npm --prefix frontend install --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier
    ```

2.  **Create `.prettierrc.json`:** Add a Prettier configuration file in `frontend/`.
    ```json
    {
      "semi": false,
      "singleQuote": true,
      "trailingComma": "es5",
      "arrowParens": "avoid",
      "printWidth": 80
    }
    ```

3.  **Update ESLint Config:** Integrate Prettier to avoid rule conflicts and add stricter Vue rules.
    -   In `frontend/.eslintrc.json`, add `"eslint-config-prettier"` to the `extends` array (must be last).

    ```json
    // In frontend/.eslintrc.json
    "extends": [
      "eslint:recommended",
      "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
      "plugin:vue/vue3-recommended",
      "prettier" // Add this LAST
    ],
    ```

4.  **Update `package.json`:** Add scripts for formatting.
    ```json
    // In frontend/package.json
    "scripts": {
      // ... existing scripts
      "format": "prettier --write src/",
      "lint:format": "npm run lint && npm run format"
    },
    ```

5.  **Update Pre-commit Hooks:** Enforce formatting on commit.
    -   In the root `/.pre-commit-config.yaml`, add a hook for frontend formatting.

    ```yaml
    # In /.pre-commit-config.yaml
    - repo: local
      hooks:
        # ... existing frontend hooks
        - id: frontend-format
          name: Format frontend code
          entry: bash -c "npm --prefix frontend run format"
          language: system
          pass_filenames: false
          files: ^frontend/src/.*\.(ts|vue|css)$
    ```

---

## Phase 1: Core Layout and Application Shell

**Goal:** Create a clean, reusable application shell and layout structure.

### Task 1.1: Refactor `App.vue` [✓]

**Goal:** Simplify `App.vue` to be a pure application shell, responsible only for the top-level layout and routing.

**Current Status:** App.vue contains ~70 lines of connection status logic that should be extracted. This refactor is well-justified.

**File to Modify:** `frontend/src/App.vue`

**Steps:**

1.  **Apply New Theme:** Remove all specific `bg-` and `text-` classes. Use the new semantic theme classes from `tailwind.config.js` (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-foreground`).
2.  **Refactor Navigation:** The `<nav>` element can be simplified. The connection status indicator should be extracted into its own component.
3.  **Implement Theme Toggling:** Add a simple button or toggle in the navigation to switch between light and dark modes. This will add/remove the `dark` class from the `<html>` element.

    ```javascript
    // Example theme toggle logic
    function toggleTheme() {
      if (document.documentElement.classList.contains('dark')) {
        document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark')
        localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light')
      } else {
        document.documentElement.classList.add('dark')
        localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark')
      }
    }
    ```

### Task 1.2: Create a `ConnectionStatus.vue` Component [✓]

**Goal:** Encapsulate the connection status indicator logic and UI into a reusable component.

**Current Status:** Component does NOT exist. The `layout` directory needs to be created. This extraction follows SOLID principles.

**New File:** `frontend/src/components/layout/ConnectionStatus.vue`

**Steps:**

1.  Move the connection status logic (computed properties for classes and text) from `App.vue` into this new component.
2.  The component should take the `connectionState` as a prop.
3.  Use the new theme colors for the indicator dot and text.

---

## Phase 2: Create the Base Component Library

**Goal:** Develop a set of small, reusable "atomic" components that will be used to build all views. This is the most critical step for achieving a consistent and maintainable UI.

**Current Status:** The `/frontend/src/components/base` directory does NOT exist. Currently using CSS classes directly with significant code duplication, especially in modals (4 modal components with 80%+ duplicate code).

**Additional Recommendations:** Consider adding these base components:
- `BaseLoader.vue` - For loading states (currently no standardized loading indicator)
- `BaseBadge.vue` - For status indicators
- `BaseAlert.vue` - For success/error/warning messages
- `BasePanel.vue` - To replace `.fantasy-panel` usage

### Task 2.1: `AppButton.vue` [✓]

**Goal:** Create a single, flexible button component.

**New File:** `frontend/src/components/base/AppButton.vue`

**Props:**
-   `variant`: `'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger'` (maps to `fantasy-button`, `fantasy-button-secondary`, etc.)
-   `size`: `'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'`
-   `disabled`: `boolean`
-   `isLoading`: `boolean`

**Implementation:**
-   Use `<slot />` for the button text/icon.
-   Use dynamic classes based on props to apply styles.
-   Include a loading spinner that shows when `isLoading` is true.

### Task 2.2: `AppCard.vue` [✓]

**Goal:** Create a standard card/panel component to replace `.fantasy-panel`.

**New File:** `frontend/src/components/base/AppCard.vue`

**Implementation:**
-   A simple wrapper with a `<slot />`.
-   The card will have the new base styles: `bg-card`, `text-foreground`, rounded corners, subtle border, and shadow.
-   Props could include `padding` (`'sm'`, `'md'`, `'lg'`) and `as` (to render as `div`, `section`, etc.).

### Task 2.3: `AppInput.vue` & `AppTextarea.vue` [✓]

**Goal:** Create standardized form input components.

**New Files:** `frontend/src/components/base/AppInput.vue`, `frontend/src/components/base/AppTextarea.vue`

**Implementation:**
-   Wrap the native `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements.
-   Apply the standardized `.fantasy-input` styles from Phase 0.
-   Include props for `label`, `placeholder`, `disabled`, `modelValue`.
-   Emit `update:modelValue` to support `v-model`.

### Task 2.4: `AppModal.vue` [✓]

**Goal:** Create a base modal component for all pop-ups.

**New File:** `frontend/src/components/base/AppModal.vue`

**Implementation:**
-   Handle the backdrop, closing logic, and transitions.
-   Use named slots (`#header`, `#body`, `#footer`) for content flexibility.
-   The modal itself will use `AppCard.vue` for its styling.

---

## Phase 3: View-by-View Refactoring

**Goal:** Incrementally refactor each view and its components to use the new design system and base components.

**Current Status:** There are 7 main views and 191 occurrences of `fantasy-*` classes to replace. GameView.vue is correctly identified as most complex (380+ lines).

**Important Note:** Create `ChatMessage.vue` component as it doesn't exist yet but is needed for `ChatHistory.vue` refactoring.

### Task 3.1: Refactor `LaunchScreen.vue` [ ]

**Files to Modify:** `frontend/src/views/LaunchScreen.vue`

**Steps:**
1.  Replace the main cards for "Campaigns", "Characters", etc., with the new `<AppCard>` component.
2.  Replace the buttons with `<AppButton>`.
3.  Adjust layout to use more whitespace and align with the new "premium" aesthetic.

### Task 3.2: Refactor `CampaignManagerView.vue` and its Components [ ]

**Files to Modify:**
-   `frontend/src/views/CampaignManagerView.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/campaign/CampaignGrid.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/campaign/CampaignTemplateGrid.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/campaign/CampaignModal.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/campaign/CampaignTemplateModal.vue`

**Steps:**
1.  **Grids:** Update `CampaignGrid.vue` and `CampaignTemplateGrid.vue` to use `<AppCard>` for each item in the grid.
2.  **Modals:** Refactor `CampaignModal.vue` and `CampaignTemplateModal.vue` to use the new `<AppModal>` as a base. Replace all internal form elements with `<AppInput>`, `<AppTextarea>`, and `<AppButton>`.
3.  **View:** Update the main view layout and buttons.

### Task 3.3: Refactor `GameView.vue` (The Most Complex) [ ]

**Files to Modify:**
-   `frontend/src/views/GameView.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/game/ChatHistory.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/game/PartyPanel.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/game/CombatStatus.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/game/InputControls.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/game/DiceRequests.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/game/MapPanel.vue`

**Recommendation:** Consider breaking this task into sub-tasks due to complexity (380+ lines in GameView). Refactor one column at a time to ensure functionality isn't broken.

**Steps:**
1.  **Main Grid:** Update the grid layout in `GameView.vue` for better spacing and balance.
2.  **Panels:** Each panel (`ChatHistory`, `PartyPanel`, etc.) should be wrapped in `<AppCard>`.
3.  **`InputControls.vue`:** Replace `<textarea>` and `<button>` with `<AppTextarea>` and `<AppButton>`.
4.  **`DiceRequests.vue`:** This is a complex component. The main container for each request group should be an `<AppCard variant="subtle">`. The roll buttons should be `<AppButton size="sm">`.
5.  **`PartyPanel.vue`:** Each party member can be a small, self-contained card. The health bar should be restyled to be cleaner.
6.  **`ChatHistory.vue`:**
    -   Create a new `ChatMessage.vue` component to encapsulate the rendering of a single message. This will clean up the `v-for` loop in `ChatHistory.vue`.
    -   Restyle the user, assistant, and system messages to be cleaner and more distinct, using the new theme colors. Add subtle animations for new messages.

### Task 3.4: Refactor `ContentManagerView.vue` and `ContentPackDetailView.vue` [ ]

**Files to Modify:**
-   `frontend/src/views/ContentManagerView.vue`
-   `frontend/src/views/ContentPackDetailView.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/content/*.vue`

**Steps:**
1.  Replace all cards, buttons, and modals with their `<App*>` equivalents.
2.  In `ContentCreationForm.vue`, replace all native form elements with the new base components.
3.  The `RAGTester.vue` is a developer tool and can be lower priority, but should still be updated to use the new components for consistency.

---

## Phase 4: Final Polish and Documentation

**Goal:** Ensure the refactor is complete, consistent, and well-documented.

### Task 4.1: Final UI/UX Polish [ ]

**Goal:** Review the entire application for visual consistency and add subtle enhancements.

**Steps:**
1.  Add smooth transitions to all interactive elements (`transition-colors`, `duration-200`).
2.  Ensure all focus states are clear and consistent (`focus:ring-2`, etc.).
3.  Check for responsive design issues on all refactored views.
4.  Verify that the light/dark mode theme switch works flawlessly across the entire application.

### Task 4.2: Code Cleanup [ ]

**Goal:** Remove any dead code or old styles.

**Steps:**
1.  Globally search for old class names like `.fantasy-panel` and remove them from the CSS and any components where they might linger.
2.  Run the linter and formatter on the entire `frontend/src` directory to catch any inconsistencies.
    ```bash
    npm --prefix frontend run lint:fix
    npm --prefix frontend run format
    ```

### Task 4.3: Update Project Documentation [ ]

**Goal:** Update developer-facing documentation to reflect the new frontend architecture.

**Files to Modify:** `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`

**Steps:**
1.  Update screenshots in `README.md` to show the new design.
2.  In `CLAUDE.md`, update the "Architecture & Code Layout" section for the frontend.
3.  Add a new section to `CLAUDE.md` titled "Frontend Design System" that explains how to use the new base components (`AppButton`, `AppCard`, etc.) and the theme-based styling approach. This is crucial for maintaining consistency in future development.
