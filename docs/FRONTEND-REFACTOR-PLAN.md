# Frontend Refactor & Redesign Implementation Plan

This document outlines the plan to refactor the frontend codebase for the AI Game Master. The primary goals are to improve the visual design, establish a consistent and maintainable design system, and enhance the overall code quality and architecture.

## Verification Status

**Last Verified:** December 26, 2024  
**Phase 0 Completed:** December 26, 2024  
**Phase 1 Completed:** December 27, 2024  
**Phase 2 Completed:** December 27, 2024  
**Phase 3 Completed:** December 28, 2024  
**Phase 4 Started:** December 28, 2024 - Complete conversion and character/campaign system redesign  
**Phase 4 Partially Completed:** December 28, 2024 - Base components created, views converted, character wizard started

✅ **Plan Validity:** All phases have been verified and the plan is sound. The refactor will:
- Eliminate significant code duplication (especially in modals with 80%+ duplicate code)
- Improve maintainability through component abstraction
- Enable theme support (light/dark modes)
- Align with project's KISS, DRY, and SOLID principles

**Key Findings:**
- 191 occurrences of `fantasy-*` classes to be replaced with components
- 4 modal components with significant duplication
- No base component library exists
- Connection status logic in App.vue (~70 lines) should be extracted
- Prettier not installed for code formatting
- CSS variables not used in Tailwind config (needed for theming)

**Guiding Principles:**

-   **No Functional Changes:** All business logic within Pinia stores and services will remain untouched. This refactor is purely for presentation and frontend code structure.
-   **Minimalism & Premium Feel:** We will blend a clean, macOS-inspired aesthetic (whitespace, rounded corners, smooth transitions) with a premium fantasy theme (typography, color palette, subtle textures).
-   **Modularity & Reusability (DRY):** We will create a library of base components to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application and reduce code duplication.
-   **Consistency:** All views and components will adhere to the new design system and coding standards.

The refactor is divided into four main phases, designed to be completed sequentially.

---

## Phase 0: Foundation and Tooling

This phase establishes the bedrock for the redesign. We will define our design system in code and enhance our development tooling to enforce quality and consistency from the start.

### Task 0.1: Establish the Design System in Tailwind CSS [✓]

**Goal:** Define a comprehensive and theme-able design system in `tailwind.config.js` to serve as the single source of truth for all styling. This will enable easy implementation of light/dark modes.

**Current Status:** Tailwind is configured with fantasy colors but NOT using CSS variables. This task is essential for theme support.

**File to Modify:** `frontend/tailwind.config.js`

**Steps:**

1.  **CSS Variables for Theming:** Introduce CSS variables for colors to allow easy switching between light (parchment) and dark themes.
    -   In `frontend/src/styles/main.css`, define the color variables within `:root` (for light mode) and a `.dark` class (for dark mode).

    ```css
    /* In frontend/src/styles/main.css */
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;

    :root {
      --color-background: 244 241 232; /* parchment */
      --color-foreground: 29 25 22;   /* almost-black text */
      --color-primary: 96 72 48;      /* fantasy-brown */
      --color-primary-foreground: 255 255 255;
      --color-accent: 212 175 55;      /* gold */
      --color-accent-foreground: 29 25 22;
      --color-card: 248 245 238;       /* lighter parchment */
      --color-border: 212 175 55;      /* gold */
    }

    .dark {
      --color-background: 29 25 22;    /* almost-black */
      --color-foreground: 232 226 208; /* off-white text */
      --color-primary: 212 175 55;     /* gold */
      --color-primary-foreground: 29 25 22;
      --color-accent: 139 92 246;      /* purple accent */
      --color-accent-foreground: 255 255 255;
      --color-card: 41 37 36;          /* dark gray */
      --color-border: 96 72 48;       /* fantasy-brown */
    }
    ```

2.  **Update Tailwind Config:** Modify `frontend/tailwind.config.js` to use these CSS variables. This makes Tailwind aware of our theme.

    ```javascript
    // In frontend/tailwind.config.js
    theme: {
      extend: {
        colors: {
          background: 'rgb(var(--color-background) / <alpha-value>)',
          foreground: 'rgb(var(--color-foreground) / <alpha-value>)',
          primary: {
            DEFAULT: 'rgb(var(--color-primary) / <alpha-value>)',
            foreground: 'rgb(var(--color-primary-foreground) / <alpha-value>)',
          },
          accent: {
            DEFAULT: 'rgb(var(--color-accent) / <alpha-value>)',
            foreground: 'rgb(var(--color-accent-foreground) / <alpha-value>)',
          },
          card: 'rgb(var(--color-card) / <alpha-value>)',
          border: 'rgb(var(--color-border) / <alpha-value>)',
        },
        borderRadius: {
          lg: '0.75rem',
          md: '0.5rem',
          sm: '0.25rem',
        },
        // ... any other theme extensions like spacing or shadows
      },
    },
    ```

### Task 0.2: Enhance Linting and Formatting [✓]

**Goal:** Enforce stricter code quality and a consistent format across all frontend files.

**Current Status:** ESLint is well-configured but Prettier is NOT installed. This task will add automatic code formatting.

**Files to Modify:** `frontend/.eslintrc.json`, `frontend/package.json`, `/.pre-commit-config.yaml`

**Steps:**

1.  **Install Prettier:** Add Prettier for consistent code formatting.
    ```bash
    npm --prefix frontend install --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier
    ```

2.  **Create `.prettierrc.json`:** Add a Prettier configuration file in `frontend/`.
    ```json
    {
      "semi": false,
      "singleQuote": true,
      "trailingComma": "es5",
      "arrowParens": "avoid",
      "printWidth": 80
    }
    ```

3.  **Update ESLint Config:** Integrate Prettier to avoid rule conflicts and add stricter Vue rules.
    -   In `frontend/.eslintrc.json`, add `"eslint-config-prettier"` to the `extends` array (must be last).

    ```json
    // In frontend/.eslintrc.json
    "extends": [
      "eslint:recommended",
      "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
      "plugin:vue/vue3-recommended",
      "prettier" // Add this LAST
    ],
    ```

4.  **Update `package.json`:** Add scripts for formatting.
    ```json
    // In frontend/package.json
    "scripts": {
      // ... existing scripts
      "format": "prettier --write src/",
      "lint:format": "npm run lint && npm run format"
    },
    ```

5.  **Update Pre-commit Hooks:** Enforce formatting on commit.
    -   In the root `/.pre-commit-config.yaml`, add a hook for frontend formatting.

    ```yaml
    # In /.pre-commit-config.yaml
    - repo: local
      hooks:
        # ... existing frontend hooks
        - id: frontend-format
          name: Format frontend code
          entry: bash -c "npm --prefix frontend run format"
          language: system
          pass_filenames: false
          files: ^frontend/src/.*\.(ts|vue|css)$
    ```

---

## Phase 1: Core Layout and Application Shell

**Goal:** Create a clean, reusable application shell and layout structure.

### Task 1.1: Refactor `App.vue` [✓]

**Goal:** Simplify `App.vue` to be a pure application shell, responsible only for the top-level layout and routing.

**Current Status:** App.vue contains ~70 lines of connection status logic that should be extracted. This refactor is well-justified.

**File to Modify:** `frontend/src/App.vue`

**Steps:**

1.  **Apply New Theme:** Remove all specific `bg-` and `text-` classes. Use the new semantic theme classes from `tailwind.config.js` (e.g., `bg-background`, `text-foreground`).
2.  **Refactor Navigation:** The `<nav>` element can be simplified. The connection status indicator should be extracted into its own component.
3.  **Implement Theme Toggling:** Add a simple button or toggle in the navigation to switch between light and dark modes. This will add/remove the `dark` class from the `<html>` element.

    ```javascript
    // Example theme toggle logic
    function toggleTheme() {
      if (document.documentElement.classList.contains('dark')) {
        document.documentElement.classList.remove('dark')
        localStorage.setItem('theme', 'light')
      } else {
        document.documentElement.classList.add('dark')
        localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark')
      }
    }
    ```

### Task 1.2: Create a `ConnectionStatus.vue` Component [✓]

**Goal:** Encapsulate the connection status indicator logic and UI into a reusable component.

**Current Status:** Component does NOT exist. The `layout` directory needs to be created. This extraction follows SOLID principles.

**New File:** `frontend/src/components/layout/ConnectionStatus.vue`

**Steps:**

1.  Move the connection status logic (computed properties for classes and text) from `App.vue` into this new component.
2.  The component should take the `connectionState` as a prop.
3.  Use the new theme colors for the indicator dot and text.

---

## Phase 2: Create the Base Component Library

**Goal:** Develop a set of small, reusable "atomic" components that will be used to build all views. This is the most critical step for achieving a consistent and maintainable UI.

**Current Status:** The `/frontend/src/components/base` directory does NOT exist. Currently using CSS classes directly with significant code duplication, especially in modals (4 modal components with 80%+ duplicate code).

**Additional Recommendations:** Consider adding these base components:
- `BaseLoader.vue` - For loading states (currently no standardized loading indicator)
- `BaseBadge.vue` - For status indicators
- `BaseAlert.vue` - For success/error/warning messages
- `BasePanel.vue` - To replace `.fantasy-panel` usage

### Task 2.1: `AppButton.vue` [✓]

**Goal:** Create a single, flexible button component.

**New File:** `frontend/src/components/base/AppButton.vue`

**Props:**
-   `variant`: `'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger'` (maps to `fantasy-button`, `fantasy-button-secondary`, etc.)
-   `size`: `'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'`
-   `disabled`: `boolean`
-   `isLoading`: `boolean`

**Implementation:**
-   Use `<slot />` for the button text/icon.
-   Use dynamic classes based on props to apply styles.
-   Include a loading spinner that shows when `isLoading` is true.

### Task 2.2: `AppCard.vue` [✓]

**Goal:** Create a standard card/panel component to replace `.fantasy-panel`.

**New File:** `frontend/src/components/base/AppCard.vue`

**Implementation:**
-   A simple wrapper with a `<slot />`.
-   The card will have the new base styles: `bg-card`, `text-foreground`, rounded corners, subtle border, and shadow.
-   Props could include `padding` (`'sm'`, `'md'`, `'lg'`) and `as` (to render as `div`, `section`, etc.).

### Task 2.3: `AppInput.vue` & `AppTextarea.vue` [✓]

**Goal:** Create standardized form input components.

**New Files:** `frontend/src/components/base/AppInput.vue`, `frontend/src/components/base/AppTextarea.vue`

**Implementation:**
-   Wrap the native `<input>` and `<textarea>` elements.
-   Apply the standardized `.fantasy-input` styles from Phase 0.
-   Include props for `label`, `placeholder`, `disabled`, `modelValue`.
-   Emit `update:modelValue` to support `v-model`.

### Task 2.4: `AppModal.vue` [✓]

**Goal:** Create a base modal component for all pop-ups.

**New File:** `frontend/src/components/base/AppModal.vue`

**Implementation:**
-   Handle the backdrop, closing logic, and transitions.
-   Use named slots (`#header`, `#body`, `#footer`) for content flexibility.
-   The modal itself will use `AppCard.vue` for its styling.

---

## Phase 3: View-by-View Refactoring

**Goal:** Incrementally refactor each view and its components to use the new design system and base components.

**Current Status:** There are 7 main views and 191 occurrences of `fantasy-*` classes to replace. GameView.vue is correctly identified as most complex (380+ lines).

**Important Note:** Create `ChatMessage.vue` component as it doesn't exist yet but is needed for `ChatHistory.vue` refactoring.

### Task 3.1: Refactor `LaunchScreen.vue` [ ]

**Files to Modify:** `frontend/src/views/LaunchScreen.vue`

**Steps:**
1.  Replace the main cards for "Campaigns", "Characters", etc., with the new `<AppCard>` component.
2.  Replace the buttons with `<AppButton>`.
3.  Adjust layout to use more whitespace and align with the new "premium" aesthetic.

### Task 3.2: Refactor `CampaignManagerView.vue` and its Components [ ]

**Files to Modify:**
-   `frontend/src/views/CampaignManagerView.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/campaign/CampaignGrid.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/campaign/CampaignTemplateGrid.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/campaign/CampaignModal.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/campaign/CampaignTemplateModal.vue`

**Steps:**
1.  **Grids:** Update `CampaignGrid.vue` and `CampaignTemplateGrid.vue` to use `<AppCard>` for each item in the grid.
2.  **Modals:** Refactor `CampaignModal.vue` and `CampaignTemplateModal.vue` to use the new `<AppModal>` as a base. Replace all internal form elements with `<AppInput>`, `<AppTextarea>`, and `<AppButton>`.
3.  **View:** Update the main view layout and buttons.

### Task 3.3: Refactor `GameView.vue` (The Most Complex) [ ]

**Files to Modify:**
-   `frontend/src/views/GameView.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/game/ChatHistory.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/game/PartyPanel.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/game/CombatStatus.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/game/InputControls.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/game/DiceRequests.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/game/MapPanel.vue`

**Recommendation:** Consider breaking this task into sub-tasks due to complexity (380+ lines in GameView). Refactor one column at a time to ensure functionality isn't broken.

**Steps:**
1.  **Main Grid:** Update the grid layout in `GameView.vue` for better spacing and balance.
2.  **Panels:** Each panel (`ChatHistory`, `PartyPanel`, etc.) should be wrapped in `<AppCard>`.
3.  **`InputControls.vue`:** Replace `<textarea>` and `<button>` with `<AppTextarea>` and `<AppButton>`.
4.  **`DiceRequests.vue`:** This is a complex component. The main container for each request group should be an `<AppCard variant="subtle">`. The roll buttons should be `<AppButton size="sm">`.
5.  **`PartyPanel.vue`:** Each party member can be a small, self-contained card. The health bar should be restyled to be cleaner.
6.  **`ChatHistory.vue`:**
    -   Create a new `ChatMessage.vue` component to encapsulate the rendering of a single message. This will clean up the `v-for` loop in `ChatHistory.vue`.
    -   Restyle the user, assistant, and system messages to be cleaner and more distinct, using the new theme colors. Add subtle animations for new messages.

### Task 3.4: Refactor `ContentManagerView.vue` and `ContentPackDetailView.vue` [ ]

**Files to Modify:**
-   `frontend/src/views/ContentManagerView.vue`
-   `frontend/src/views/ContentPackDetailView.vue`
-   `frontend/src/components/content/*.vue`

**Steps:**
1.  Replace all cards, buttons, and modals with their `<App*>` equivalents.
2.  In `ContentCreationForm.vue`, replace all native form elements with the new base components.
3.  The `RAGTester.vue` is a developer tool and can be lower priority, but should still be updated to use the new components for consistency.

---

## Phase 4: Complete Component Conversion & Redesign Character/Campaign System

**Goal:** Convert all remaining components to use the new base component library and completely redesign the character/campaign creation system to be more intuitive, content-pack aware, and less error-prone.

### Current Issues to Address:
1. Configuration and Character views still use old styling system
2. All character/campaign creation modals use old components and hardcoded options
3. Content packs are globally activated instead of per-character
4. Character creation is confusing and error-prone
5. No clear relationship between content packs and character options

### Why This Phase is Critical:
The current character/campaign creation system has fundamental design flaws that make it difficult for users:
- **Content Pack Confusion:** Users don't understand which content is available or where it comes from
- **Hardcoded Limitations:** Many options are hardcoded instead of dynamically loaded from content packs
- **Poor User Experience:** The current multi-tab interface is confusing and error-prone
- **Inflexibility:** Global content pack activation doesn't support mixed campaigns or player preferences

By redesigning these systems, we will:
- Make character creation intuitive with a step-by-step wizard
- Allow per-character content pack selection for maximum flexibility
- Dynamically load all options from content packs
- Provide clear visibility into content sources
- Improve campaign-character compatibility checking

### Task 4.1: Create Additional Base Components ✓

**Goal:** Build specialized base components for complex UI patterns found in the remaining views.

**Status: COMPLETED** - All base components created and working

**New Components Created:**
1. **`AppTabs.vue`** - Tab navigation component for multi-step forms
   - Props: `tabs` (array of tab objects), `activeTab`, `variant`
   - Emits: `update:activeTab`
   - Used in: Configuration, Character/Campaign modals

2. **`AppNumberInput.vue`** - Number input with increment/decrement buttons
   - Props: `modelValue`, `min`, `max`, `step`, `label`
   - Used for: Ability scores, level selection, hit points

3. **`AppCheckboxGroup.vue`** - Group of checkboxes with select all/none
   - Props: `options`, `modelValue`, `columns`, `label`
   - Used for: Skills, proficiencies, content pack selection

4. **`AppDynamicList.vue`** - Add/remove list management component
   - Props: `items`, `itemComponent`, `addLabel`, `maxItems`
   - Used for: Equipment, spells, NPCs, quests

5. **`AppFormSection.vue`** - Section wrapper with title and description
   - Props: `title`, `description`, `collapsible`
   - Used for: Grouping related form fields

### Task 4.2: Convert Configuration & Character Views ✓

**Goal:** Update the main views that haven't been converted yet.

**Status: COMPLETED** - All views converted to use base components

**Files Updated:**
1. **`ConfigurationScreen.vue`**
   - Replace all `fantasy-*` classes with base components
   - Use `AppTabs` for settings sections
   - Replace native form elements with base components
   - Update all hardcoded colors to theme classes

2. **`CharactersManagerScreen.vue`**
   - Replace `fantasy-panel` with `AppCard`
   - Use `AppButton` for all buttons
   - Replace error message box with `BaseAlert`
   - Update all color classes to theme system

3. **`TemplateGrid.vue`**
   - Replace `fantasy-panel` with `AppCard`
   - Use `AppButton` for action buttons
   - Update all hardcoded colors

### Task 4.3: Redesign Character Creation System ~

**Goal:** Create a new character creation flow that's intuitive and content-pack aware.

**Status: PARTIALLY COMPLETED** - Steps 1-4 implemented, 5-7 pending

**New Character Creation Flow:**
1. **Step 1: Content Pack Selection** (NEW - REQUIRED)
   - Show all available content packs with rich previews
   - Display pack statistics (X races, Y classes, Z spells, etc.)
   - Allow multi-select with checkboxes
   - System pack (D&D 5e SRD) pre-selected but can be deselected
   - Show content pack compatibility warnings if any

2. **Step 2: Basic Information**
   - Name and alignment
   - Background selection from chosen packs
   - Show which pack each background comes from
   - Preview background features and proficiencies

3. **Step 3: Race & Class Selection**
   - Two-column layout: Race on left, Class on right
   - Filter and search within available options
   - Show source pack badge for each option
   - Display full racial traits and class features
   - Show subrace/subclass options immediately

4. **Step 4: Ability Scores**
   - Three methods: Point Buy, Standard Array, or Roll
   - Live calculation of modifiers and derived stats
   - Show racial bonuses applied automatically
   - Validation to ensure legal scores

5. **Step 5: Skills & Proficiencies**
   - Grouped by source (Class, Race, Background)
   - Show skill descriptions on hover
   - Validate selection count based on class/background
   - Allow expertise selection for applicable classes

6. **Step 6: Equipment & Spells**
   - Starting equipment based on class/background
   - Choose between standard equipment or starting gold
   - Spell selection for spellcasters with pack filtering
   - Show spell details in modal when clicked
   - Cantrip and spell slot management

7. **Step 7: Review & Confirm**
   - Full character sheet preview
   - Validation summary showing any issues
   - Option to go back and edit any section
   - Save character with selected content packs

**Implementation:** ✓
- Created new `CharacterCreationWizard.vue` component ✓
- Uses progress bar instead of tabs for better wizard UX ✓
- Stores content pack selection in character data ✓
- Loads all options dynamically from selected packs ✓
- Integrated into CharactersManagerScreen.vue ✓

### Task 4.4: Redesign Campaign Creation System

**Goal:** Improve campaign creation to work with the new character system.

**Changes to Campaign Creation:**
1. **Content Pack Compatibility**
   - When creating a campaign, show all content packs used by selected characters
   - Campaign automatically includes union of all character content packs
   - Display clear warnings if characters use vastly different pack sets
   - Option to restrict campaign to specific packs (characters must be compatible)

2. **Character Selection Improvements**
   - New character selection grid with rich previews
   - Show character level, class, race, and content packs
   - Filter by: content pack compatibility, class, level, etc.
   - Visual indicators for pack compatibility (green = full match, yellow = partial, red = incompatible)

3. **Template Improvements**
   - Complete removal of ALL hardcoded options
   - Dynamic loading based on campaign's content packs
   - Improved NPC editor with class/race selection from packs
   - Quest templates that reference pack-specific content
   - Better organization with collapsible sections

### Task 4.5: Update Content Pack Management

**Goal:** Change from global activation to per-character selection.

**Changes:**
1. **Remove Activate/Deactivate buttons** from content manager entirely
2. **Replace with "Available for Selection" toggle** - controls whether pack appears in character creation
3. **Show usage statistics** - display how many characters use each pack
4. **Add content pack details view** showing all included content (spells, races, classes, etc.)
5. **Content Pack Dependencies** - show if a pack requires other packs
6. **Search and Filter** - allow searching content within packs

### Task 4.6: Data Model Updates

**Goal:** Update the data models to support per-character content packs.

**Changes:**
1. Add `content_pack_ids: string[]` to character templates (required field)
2. Update character creation to save selected packs
3. Modify API calls to include content pack filtering
4. Remove global `is_active` flag from content packs (or repurpose as "available for selection")
5. Update campaign models to work with character-specific content packs

**Migration Strategy:**
- Create a migration script that assigns all currently active packs to existing characters
- After migration, remove the global activation system entirely
- All new characters MUST select their content packs during creation
- No fallback to "all active packs" - explicit selection required

## Phase 5: Final Polish and Documentation

### Task 5.2: Implement Missing Backend Features [ ]

**Goal:** Implement backend API endpoints for features that currently have incomplete functionality.

**Priority:** HIGH - These APIs are needed before final UI polish since some UI components depend on this data.

**Required Backend Features:**

1. **Content Pack Statistics API** ⭐ **NEEDED**
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/content-packs/{pack_id}/stats`
   - **Response Format:** 
     ```json
     {
       "races_count": 15,
       "classes_count": 12,
       "spells_count": 245,
       "monsters_count": 89,
       "items_count": 156,
       "backgrounds_count": 13
     }
     ```
   - **Purpose:** Show accurate content counts in `ContentPackSelectionStep.vue`
   - **Current Issue:** Component shows empty stats due to missing endpoint
   - **Implementation Notes:**
     - Query content database for each content type
     - Cache results for performance
     - Filter by pack ID

2. **Character Creation Validation API** ⭐ **USEFUL**
   - **Endpoint:** `/api/character-templates/validate` (POST)
   - **Request Body:** Character creation data
   - **Response:** Validation errors and warnings
   - **Purpose:** Server-side D5e rules validation
   - **Implementation Notes:**
     - Validate ability score totals and methods
     - Check skill selection limits by class/background
     - Verify spell selections match class spell lists
     - Ensure content pack availability and compatibility

**APIs Already Implemented (No Work Needed):**

✅ **Class-Specific Spell Filtering** - Current API: `/api/d5e/content?type=spells&class_name={class}&level={level}&content_pack_ids={ids}`
✅ **Dynamic Alignments** - Already included in `/api/character-creation-options` response
✅ **Subrace Data** - Available via `/api/d5e/content/subraces/{subrace_id}` with full ability bonuses

### Task 5.3: Final UI/UX Polish [ ]

**Goal:** Review the entire application for visual consistency and add subtle enhancements.

**Steps:**
1.  Add smooth transitions to all interactive elements (`transition-colors`, `duration-200`).
2.  Ensure all focus states are clear and consistent (`focus:ring-2`, etc.).
3.  Check for responsive design issues on all refactored views.
4.  Verify that the light/dark mode theme switch works flawlessly across the entire application.
5.  Add loading states and skeleton screens where appropriate.
6.  Ensure proper error handling UI throughout the application.

### Task 5.4: Code Cleanup [ ]

**Goal:** Remove any dead code or old styles.

**Steps:**
1.  Globally search for old class names like `.fantasy-panel` and remove them from the CSS and any components where they might linger.
2.  Remove any unused CSS classes and styles.
3.  Clean up any TODO comments and console.logs.
4.  Run the linter and formatter on the entire `frontend/src` directory to catch any inconsistencies.
    ```bash
    npm --prefix frontend run lint:fix
    npm --prefix frontend run format
    ```
5.  Ensure all components have proper TypeScript types.

**Additional Items from Phase 4 Verification:**
1. **TypeScript Warnings:**
   - Fix "requires default value" warnings in base components:
     - AppCheckboxGroup.vue (4 warnings)
     - AppDynamicList.vue (5 warnings + type safety issues)
     - AppFormSection.vue (2 warnings)
     - AppInput.vue (5 warnings)
     - AppModal.vue (1 warning)
     - AppNumberInput.vue (6 warnings)
     - AppTextarea.vue (5 warnings)
     - BaseAlert.vue (5 warnings)
     - BaseLoader.vue (1 warning)
   - Fix type safety issues in CharacterCreationWizard.vue (18 errors)
   - Fix "any" type usage in AppDynamicList.vue

2. **CSS Cleanup:**
   - Keep `fantasy-scrollbar` utility class (intentional custom scrollbar styling)
   - Review if any other legacy CSS can be removed

3. **Component Structure:**
   - BaseAlert.vue has multiple components in one file (icon components)
   - Consider extracting icon components to separate files

### Task 5.5: Update Project Documentation [ ]

**Goal:** Update developer-facing documentation to reflect the new frontend architecture.

**Files to Modify:** `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`

**Steps:**
1.  Update screenshots in `README.md` to show the new design.
2.  In `CLAUDE.md`, update the "Architecture & Code Layout" section for the frontend.
3.  Add a new section to `CLAUDE.md` titled "Frontend Design System" that explains:
    - How to use the new base components (`AppButton`, `AppCard`, etc.)
    - Theme-based styling approach
    - Content pack system and character creation flow
    - Best practices for maintaining consistency
4.  Document the new character/campaign creation workflow.
5.  Add component usage examples and guidelines.
